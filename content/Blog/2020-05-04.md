So yesterday I got out and walked up the 2.5 miles/900 foot rise of
the section of the Appalachian Trail form VA-55 to the Manassas Gap
shelter.   It reminded me that you really do have to do serious
workout to stay in shape.   I had been going for 1 or 2 hour walks
around the house (flat), but it became clear, that even on that short
"easy" walk it was not enough.  I got back to my body-weight workouts
this morning.

Day 05 of #100DaysToOffload.
