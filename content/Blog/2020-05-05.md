Getting started in life is harder right now.  I have two college age
sons who both just finished up their year with online classes, and
both are home now. In "normal" times they would be working summer jobs or participating
in other activities that would help them advance toward their chosen
careers.  Jobs may or may not happen.  Even getting out of the house
may not happen much.  These are weird times.

I am happy to help my sons with a place to live, emotional and other
support, but it is a time of life where they should be moving towards
increased independence.  The opportunities to do that are drastically
reduced right now.  This state of affairs concerns me, and it's not
just my family.  Maybe we need to look for the silver lining, find
opportunity in change, etc., but it is certainly going to take more
effort and intentionality right now.
