I find that when I stay glued to twitter (pick your
social-media-of-doom-amplifier) I tend to get a rather gloomy view of
life.  There is indeed a lot one can be gloomy about these days.  But
if you just go for a walk and look around you may be
surprised:

I found this art [sidewalk art](#org6d66a96) at just about the exact place where last
fall I had purchased a cup of lemonade from 4 eager young
entrepreneurs.  I suspect the ring leader of that optimistic young
bunch.

Spring is the best time of year.  The daffodils bloom, [dogwoods are in
full bloom](#org6f1df79), red-bud trees come out, the tree-frogs sing up a storm (at
least that's how it goes in Virginia)

I recently had my yard re-graded and re-seeded and now, after 17 years
I have [full luscious grass](#orgffb8d50) (that has to be mowed).  This may not happen
again:

And last but not least I saw a bird I don't think I've seen before,
it turned out to be a common [tree swallow](#org2b124a8), but it was startling to see
the almost metallic, shinny dark blue back and white belly (the
picture does not capture it well)

Go for a walk.  Look at the world around you.  It's spring.  All is
not doom and gloom!
