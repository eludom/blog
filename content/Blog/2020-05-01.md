_This article is a work in progress.  Updated: 2020-05-02.  This is
turning into a bit of a catch-up on the state of DNS for me._

Day 03 and 04 of #100DaysToOffload.


## Intro {#intro}

The war against ads continues. <https://pi-hole.net/> looks like a
reasonable, good, new?, open source entry in the war against ads. Get
'yer source/install for linux at <https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole>

Per Paul Vixie

> not even non-technical users need a "public DNS" to shield themselves
> from a lot of known-evil internet sites. check out @The\_Pi\_Hole or
> have your 12yo child or cousin install it.

..but I always make things harder.

## What {#what}

-   It's a local DNS server to block adds.


## Why {#why}

-   Blocking ads is a moral good.
-   I've not done home network hacking for a while.
-   I'm moving into a bit of a more "don't track me" frame of mind.


## When {#when}

-   Now, because I'm home more during corona-virus.


## How {#how}

-   Set up local server.
-   First on a Linux laptop that (usually) does not go off the net.
-   Then maybe on an old pogoplug or laptop.


## Install It {#install-it}

Here's what I did to instlal

[ ] basic install
: On a Linux server, the **basic** install is
    simple:

    ```text
                sudo bash basic-install.sh
    ```


[ ] Static IP
: But you will want a Linux box with a static IP
    address. This may involve, e.g., convincing your wireless
    router to hand out a the same static IP to a static IP


[ ] Tell other systems to use this IP for DNS
: Again,
    probably configuring your wireless router to specify your local
    IP as the DNS server for DNS assignments via DHCP assignments.
    You could also do this by configuring the individual devices to
    use it.


[ ] Remember your admin password
: Make note of the admin password during install


[ ] hit the local admin web server
: Its a very nice.  It will
    be at a something like  <http://192.168.86.230/admin/index.php>.


## Test It {#test-it}

[ ] Look something up by hand
: Use dig(1) or host(1).  Note
    the `SERVER` in the response below that shows where the answer
    came from.  If it's your IPS's DNS or Google, try again
    (something's not configured right).  In my case 127.1 is right.

-   [ ] Check the query logs via the UI to make sure your target domain
    showed.   Be aware of caching.  It may only show up the first
    time you query.

-   [ ] Find your favorite 90s-era web site,
    go hit it, and watch the counters
    -   <http://computershopper.com>
    -   <http://www.yahoo.com>
    -   <http://www.compuserve.com>
    -   <http://www.aol.com>
    -   <http://sears.com> (get it while it lasts)

-   If the counters go crazy and you don't see the expected
    plethora of ads, you win.  If not dig deeper.

-   If you are already
    using ad-blockers or browsers such as Brave that block ads, you
    may have to test with something else (Firefox, Chrome, etc.)

-   Browser and other apps are getting cagey about using not using
    the system DNS, using DOH, and otherwise not acting like you
    expect them too.  Editing `/etc/resolv.conf` is not the whole
    game anymore.


## Tools you may want to use/learn/install {#tools-you-may-want-to-use-learn-install}

dig
: for making/testing queries by hand

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
: Use Wireshark to see what's going on on the wire,
    who you're talking to, etc.


## The things you learn {#the-things-you-learn}

-   pi-hole can apparently function as a DHCP server itself.

-   You can choose your upstream DNS servers from a list with
    options for IPv4, IPv6, DNSSEC/no DNSSEC, filtered/unfiltered.
-   Quad9 is one of the choices.  It looks to be really useful for
    adding malware blocking to your domain.  See
    <https://www.quad9.net/faq/> for a useful bit of education.

-   The logs are at `/var/log/pihole.log`

-   Possibly use [Marcus Ranums's principal of "Artificial Ignorance"](http://www.ranum.com/security/computer%5Fsecurity/papers/ai/)
    to grep out the known and see what's left:

    What is this stuff?


## Tune it {#tune-it}

I'm not sure all the devices in the house are using the P-hole
proxy.  If they are, then they are showing up as the single
device \_gateway.   I need to understand this and figure out if I
can get other devices pulling wireless addresses via DHCP from
the WAP to use the Pi-hole DNS directly.   Stay tuned.
