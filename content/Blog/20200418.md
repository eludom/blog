Bash uses linear search to insert values in to associative arrays.
This is all well and good for small numbers of keys.   I was adding
millions[^fn:1].    I went poking around the bash source code today
(2020-04-18) to confirm my suspicion and gauge the difficulty of
adding an option to do something more sensible.

<!--more-->

Here the steps I took and where I might go if I get serious about
fixing the problem:


## Get the source code {#get-the-source-code}


### Find it {#find-it}

find the homepage
: A quick bit of googling lead to the homepage <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/bash/>

use git
: For a minute it looked like GNU was still stuck in the bad old
    days of having to download a tarball and then apply a series
    of patches, but fortunately, it there is a git repo <http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=bash>


### Download it {#download-it}

```bash
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/bash.git
```


### Build it {#build-it}

Bash follows a time honored build convention

```bash
./configure
make
```


### Analyze it {#analyze-it}

-   I read the NEWS file for any indication that associative arrays
    has been worked on to speed up associative array
    insert/look-ups.  No indication that they had.
-   I checked the git commit logs, which appear to be meaningful
    after Bash-4.4 patch 19.  Nothing.
-   With judicious use of grep ("grep-find in Emacs") for
    "associative" and "hash\_search" it turns out that associative
    array inserts (as all inserts) are done with use of the
    "hash\_search" function in `hashlib.c`
-   has\_insert() begins as follows:

<!--listend-->

```C
/* Create an entry for STRING, in TABLE.  If the entry already
   exists, then return it (unless the HASH_NOSRCH flag is set). */
BUCKET_CONTENTS *
hash_insert (string, table, flags)
     char *string;
     HASH_TABLE *table;
     int flags;
{
  BUCKET_CONTENTS *item;
  int bucket;
  unsigned int hv;

  if (table == 0)
    table = hash_create (0);

  item = (flags & HASH_NOSRCH) ? (BUCKET_CONTENTS *)NULL
                               : hash_search (string, table, 0);
```

-   and there it is, the linear search walking the list in
    `hash_search()`

<!--listend-->

```C
/* Return a pointer to the hashed item.  If the HASH_CREATE flag is passed,
   create a new hash table entry for STRING, otherwise return NULL. */
BUCKET_CONTENTS *
hash_search (string, table, flags)
     const char *string;
     HASH_TABLE *table;
     int flags;
{
  BUCKET_CONTENTS *list;
  int bucket;
  unsigned int hv;

  if (table == 0 || ((flags & HASH_CREATE) == 0 && HASH_ENTRIES (table) == 0))
    return (BUCKET_CONTENTS *)NULL;

  bucket = HASH_BUCKET (string, table, hv);

  for (list = table->bucket_array ? table->bucket_array[bucket] : 0; list; list = list->next)
    {
      /* This is the comparison function */
      if (hv == list->khash && STREQ (list->key, string))
        {
          list->times_found++;
          return (list);
        }
    }
```

#### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Reach out to the maintainers {#reach-out-to-the-maintainers}

see if they would even entertain the idea of a patch


#### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Look for appropriate in-memory hash insert/lookup functions {#look-for-appropriate-in-memory-hash-insert-lookup-functions}

-   btrees ?


#### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Code it {#code-it}


#### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> test it {#test-it}


#### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> submit patch {#submit-patch}

[^fn:1]: yes, there are many better tools for this job, but not in the constrained environment where this had to run.
