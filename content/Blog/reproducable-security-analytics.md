I'm looking for repositories of "reproducible security analytics".

As an addict of [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) [Org mode](https://orgmode.org/), one of the papers that got me started
thinking along these lines was [A Multi-Language Computing Environment
for Literate Programming and Reproducible Research](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v046i03/v46i03.pdf). I realize for most
of the rest of the world this vision is now realized more in things
like Jupyter and Zeppelin notebooks. Your loss :-)

One thing that looks promising is [mitre's cyber analytics
repository](https://car.mitre.org/). Another is [Hunters Forge/Mordor](https://github.com/hunters-forge/mordor) I'd be interested in
pointers to more.
