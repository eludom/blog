And on a happy note...my son Bryan has finished his Masters of
Piano Performance at Duquesne University and will be headed to
Penn State to pursue a Doctor of Musical Arts.  You can watch
listen to [Bryan Jones' masters degree piano recitle at Duquesne](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp9RFZrc7DMtCEg0SmtEL5weDiTis3rH5) on
Youtube.

## Bryan's Music {#bryan-s-music}

The corona virus has wreaked havoc with many things, not the least
of which is the performing arts, but, as they say, "the show must
go on".  The program was to have been a live performance, but
things being what they are (social distancing) recordings where
made to satisfy the requirement.

The program includes:

-   Schumann: Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13 (original version, 1837)
-   Debussy: Images Book II - I. Cloches Ã  travers les feuilles
-   Debussy: Images Book II - II. Et la lune descend sur le temple qui fut
-   Debussy: Images Book II - III. Poissons d'or
-   Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - I. Allegro marcato
-   Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - II. Presto misterioso
-   Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - III. Adagio molto appassionato
-   Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - IV. Ruvido ed ostinato

I particularly like the Debussy.


## Other Happy Notes {#other-happy-notes}

My other son Daniel is finishing out his junior year at Cedarville
from home.  Bryan's girlfriend (also graduating from Duquesne) will
again spend the summer doing something she loves, counting birds for
Bird Conservancy of the Rockies.  A "kid" I knew from scouting is
headed off for a masters in biomedical engineering this fall, and we
may hike together a week or two if possible in June or July.

Life goes on.   All is not doom and gloom.   There are some happy
notes.  Share some of yours?
