I recently picked up reader of samples of important ancient texts
that I've had for a LONG time and read excerpts from Socrates
Apology.  Short version:

Oracle of Delphi
: "Socrates is the wisest man"

Socrates
: Nice hypothesis, Apollo, you may be a god, but let's test it....

Socrates
: Seeks out "The Wise" of his day, Politicians, Poets,
    Artisans ... questions them ... has them all expose themselves
    as blithering idiots.

Socrates
: OK, "The Wise" are all blithering idiots.  They are
    not wise.   The hypothesis holds ... for now.

The Wise
: (still mad), Yo, Socrates, here's some hemlock
    (poison).  Drink up...

There is nothing new under the sun.  In the mid 20th century, in
response to questions about "what is a science" Karl Popper
proposed "falsification" as a way do delineate scientific theories
from non-scientific theories.  The basic idea is that one
counter-example disproves a theory.

Socrates defense (5th century BC) is a clear example of the method
Popper had in mind.  There is nothing new under the sun.   And if
we follow Popper and Socrates, "the science" (or the pronouncement
of the god) is never "settled".   Conclusions are always
tentative and are always just one counter example away from being
rejected.
