"I'm passionate about..." I've always hated that phrase. Because I
thought it was fake. I thought it was trendy. I've reflexively reacted
against trendy things for decades. Pet Rocks, Disco, TED talks,
cryptocurrency... But I am coming to see what the phrase is getting
at. And I think I like it.

In a work world where human beings are called "resources", where
intelligent, creative, inquisitive, motivated people are subjected to
management practices derived from 19th century steel mills and
automotive assembly line production, the phrase "I'm passionate
about..." is (can be) an attempt to re-assert humanity.

I've just finished reading [Long Live Latin: The Pleasures of a Useless
Language](https://www.amazon.com/Long-Live-Latin-Pleasures-Language/dp/0374284520#ace-8881249860) . For no good reason. Again and again, it raises the question
of what it means to be human: to be joyful, spontaneous, creative,
inquisitive, fulfilled, to discover, to appreciate beauty, music, art,
language, and poetry (yes, I have a liberal arts degree)

I guess if I had to say what I'm passionate about, it's about being
human and treating other people as humans. To put a professional spin
on it "I am passionate about collaborating with technical people to
find creative solutions to important problems."

Go learn a useless language. Climb a mountain and enjoy the
view. Spend time playing games with your family. Be human. Be
passionate. Carpe diem.
