You learn things when you read original sources for yourself.

I recently picked up a copy of [Plato's allegory of "The Cave"](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.8.vii.html).  I had
known some of the highlights of the story before, the shadows on the
wall, prisoners thinking that the shadows were reality, since that's
all they ever knew, of one prisoner being taken out to see the sun and
seeing the true light, coming back down and trying to, literally,
enlighten his fellows, and being thought crazy.

But I had not known the context until reading the original.  He was
talking about the need for rulers of the state to have a higher
vision, to have a view of truth, of the transcendent, to willingly
leave the ivory tower, the "Isle of the blessed" if you will, where
they desired to spend their whole life in contemplation of the truth,
and to willingly go back into the cave to enlighten their brethren and
lead with a knowldge of truth, not desiring the mundane (and false)
trappings of the world of shadows (power, wealth, leisure, goods) for
their own sake and for their own use.  Rulers who do not have that
vision, and who only focus on this life are bad rulers, and everyone
(including the rulers) loose out.
