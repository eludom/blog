Life goes on, until it doesn't.  Then those of us who are still here
are often left with the cherished collections of a generation, or two,
or three, or four, or...  The oldest thing I think I have in the house
is this page torn out of a family bible (I have at least 3 of them,
big, old, once-cherished).  It records the death of a William Gould in
1792, and of Joseph Dennis Gould in 1835.

I also have lecture notes Joseph Gould took at seminary, as describe
in this slightly edited email I sent to a relative a few years ago.
There were some big things going on in those days.

I'm not sure what to make of all this.  It's good to know where you
came from.  There are stories and values associated with some of these
things.  It's good to remember the trials and victories of those who
came before.
