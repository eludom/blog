George Jones is a Christian, husband, father, technical security
geek etc., backpacker, Latin, Classics, and Philosophy dabbler,
Emacs Org Mode addict, Cincinnati Reds and Skyline Chili fan.  In
something like that order.  He tries to combine his passions and
has thus been know to write Latin entries in Appalachian Trail
shelter log books ("Via longa sed vita brevis"), and write blog
posts about the intersection of epistemology and computer security.
You have a lot of time to think when hiking or stuck at home during
a pandemic.  Maybe too much :-)

Professionally George has made a living variously as a programmer,
systems administrator, network security engineer, open source
software developer, Internet Standards author (RFC3871), security
researcher, conference chair (Flocon 2013, 2014), security
analytics developer and data scientist.  He has been employed
variously by CompuServe, UUNET, MITRE, Carnegie-Mellon/CERT, Amazon
and Redjack.  See  <https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgemjones/>
