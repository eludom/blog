I'm looking for repositories of "reproducible security analytics".

As an addict of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] [[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]], one of the papers that got me started
thinking along these lines was [[https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v046i03/v46i03.pdf][A Multi-Language Computing Environment
for Literate Programming and Reproducible Research]]. I realize for most
of the rest of the world this vision is now realized more in things
like Jupyter and Zeppelin notebooks. Your loss :-)

One thing that looks promising is [[https://car.mitre.org/][mitre's cyber analytics
repository]]. Another is [[https://github.com/hunters-forge/mordor][Hunters Forge/Mordor]] I'd be interested in
pointers to more.

"I'm passionate about..." I've always hated that phrase. Because I
thought it was fake. I thought it was trendy. I've reflexively reacted
against trendy things for decades. Pet Rocks, Disco, TED talks,
cryptocurrency... But I am coming to see what the phrase is getting
at. And I think I like it.

In a work world where human beings are called "resources", where
intelligent, creative, inquisitive, motivated people are subjected to
management practices derived from 19th century steel mills and
automotive assembly line production, the phrase "I'm passionate
about..." is (can be) an attempt to re-assert humanity.

I've just finished reading [[https://www.amazon.com/Long-Live-Latin-Pleasures-Language/dp/0374284520#ace-8881249860][Long Live Latin: The Pleasures of a Useless
Language]] . For no good reason. Again and again, it raises the question
of what it means to be human: to be joyful, spontaneous, creative,
inquisitive, fulfilled, to discover, to appreciate beauty, music, art,
language, and poetry (yes, I have a liberal arts degree)

I guess if I had to say what I'm passionate about, it's about being
human and treating other people as humans. To put a professional spin
on it "I am passionate about collaborating with technical people to
find creative solutions to important problems."

Go learn a useless language. Climb a mountain and enjoy the
view. Spend time playing games with your family. Be human. Be
passionate. Carpe diem.

*** PUBLISHED Bear attacks, no-win situations and cybersecurity :cybersecurity:bears:

I spend a good amount of time hiking in Shenandoah National Park and
surrounding areas. I've seen quite a few #bears and I've followed one
down the trail. I've been growled at by a mother bear when I
unknowingly came between her and her cubs. This is going somewhere
related to #cybersecurity. I promise.

You can't outrun a bear. Climbing a tree won't help. If a bear
actually decides to attack you, the odds are not in your favor, but
fortunately they almost never attack. The old joke goes "I don't have
to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun you" because, presumably the
bear will catch your slower partner, stop, and not bother you when you
both decide to run for it in violation of bear encounter best
practices.

This hints at any number of cybersecurity principals:

  - Know your threat model.
  - Know and follow best practices.
  - Don't let fear (or adrenaline) dictate your response.
  - Know and practice situationally appropriate responses (Grizzlies:
    if attacked play dead. Black Bear: if attacked fight for your
    life)
  - Be prepared (bear spray, first aid kit)
  - Practice deterrence (make noise, travel in groups)
  - Prevention costs less than recovery. By far.
  - And, of course, make sure the other guy is an easier target. Run faster if you run. Apply patches, have good backups (Hello, ransomware !), have layers of defense, decoys, monitoring, DLP, practice threat hunting, etc.
     For a decade or so, I've been reflecting on the fact that
    defensive cybersecurity is a loosing igame. The red team
    (attackers) always win. I don't like no-win situations.

There's a lesson here:

    - Don't feed the bears :: They become habituated to humans, loose
         their inhibition, become a nuisance and sometimes have to be
         relocated or killed. Nobody wins.

OK, not that lesson. Lessons like:

    - Follow best practices :: Following best practices CAN help avoid
         problems. Not following best practices WILL invite problems.
    - Have an incident response plan :: If you see a bad thing
         happening, if it is coming straight for you, what do you do?
    - Line up the right resources ::  Do you know how to triage
         wounds? Do you have a cell phone? Are you in range of cell
         towers? If not, do you have a SPOT to call for help? Where is
         the nearest hospital? Are you prepared to shelter in place if
         need be?
    - It's not just you :: Feeding the bears or failing to store food
         properly might result in perfectly good backcountry shelters
         being torn down. And here we are, 20 or so years after it
         became clear that that allowing spoofed packets out of your
         network enables #DDoS #attacks and we *still* do not have
         widespread adoption of reverse path forwarding
         checks. *Please* stop spoofed packets at your border !


So it maybe true that few people win in the face of an actual attack,
but, it turns out, there are still good reasons to play the game.

*** PUBLISHED Fixing GNU bash associative array insert speed :programming:gnu:linux:

Bash uses linear search to insert values in to associative arrays.
This is all well and good for small numbers of keys.   I was adding
millions[fn:1].    I went poking around the bash source code today
(2020-04-18) to confirm my suspicion and gauge the difficulty of
adding an option to do something more sensible.


In less than a day after I reported it, there is a patch
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2020-04/msg00114.html My
timing code and pre and post patch timings are here:
https://github.com/eludom/snippits/tree/master/bash/tests

#+hugo: more

Here the steps I took and where I might go if I get serious about
fixing the problem:

**** Get the source code

***** Find it
      - find the homepage :: A quick bit of googling lead to the homepage http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/bash/
      - use git :: For a minute it looked like GNU was still stuck in the bad old
        days of having to download a tarball and then apply a series
        of patches, but fortunately, it there is a git repo http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=bash
***** Download it
      #+begin_src bash :eval no
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/bash.git
      #+end_src
***** Build it

      Bash follows a time honored build convention
      #+begin_src bash :results output :eval no
./configure
make
      #+end_src

***** Analyze it
      - I read the NEWS file for any indication that associative arrays
        has been worked on to speed up associative array
        insert/look-ups.  No indication that they had.
      - I checked the git commit logs, which appear to be meaningful
        after Bash-4.4 patch 19.  Nothing.
      - With judicious use of grep ("grep-find in Emacs") for
        "associative" and "hash_search" it turns out that associative
        array inserts (as all inserts) are done with use of the
        "hash_search" function in =hashlib.c=
      - has_insert() begins as follows:
#+begin_src C
/* Create an entry for STRING, in TABLE.  If the entry already
   exists, then return it (unless the HASH_NOSRCH flag is set). */
BUCKET_CONTENTS *
hash_insert (string, table, flags)
     char *string;
     HASH_TABLE *table;
     int flags;
{
  BUCKET_CONTENTS *item;
  int bucket;
  unsigned int hv;

  if (table == 0)
    table = hash_create (0);

  item = (flags & HASH_NOSRCH) ? (BUCKET_CONTENTS *)NULL
                               : hash_search (string, table, 0);
#+end_src
      - and there it is, the linear search walking the list in
        =hash_search()=
#+begin_src C
/* Return a pointer to the hashed item.  If the HASH_CREATE flag is passed,
   create a new hash table entry for STRING, otherwise return NULL. */
BUCKET_CONTENTS *
hash_search (string, table, flags)
     const char *string;
     HASH_TABLE *table;
     int flags;
{
  BUCKET_CONTENTS *list;
  int bucket;
  unsigned int hv;

  if (table == 0 || ((flags & HASH_CREATE) == 0 && HASH_ENTRIES (table) == 0))
    return (BUCKET_CONTENTS *)NULL;

  bucket = HASH_BUCKET (string, table, hv);

  for (list = table->bucket_array ? table->bucket_array[bucket] : 0; list; list = list->next)
    {
      /* This is the comparison function */
      if (hv == list->khash && STREQ (list->key, string))
        {
          list->times_found++;
          return (list);
        }
    }
#+end_src


**** Next steps
***** DONE Reach out to the maintainers
      see if they would even entertain the idea of a patch
***** CANCELED Look for appropriate in-memory hash insert/lookup functions
      - btrees ?
***** CANCELED Code it
***** CANCELED test it
***** CANCELED submit patch
      See https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2020-04/msg00114.html

    Piano Performance at Duquesne University and will be headed to
    Penn State to pursue a Doctor of Musical Arts.  You can watch

**** Bryan's Music

    The corona virus has wreaked havoc with many things, not the least
    of which is the performing arts, but, as they say, "the show must
    go on".  The program was to have been a live performance, but
    things being what they are (social distancing) recordings where
    made to satisfy the requirement.

    The program includes:

    - Schumann: Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13 (original version, 1837)
    - Debussy: Images Book II - I. Cloches à travers les feuilles
    - Debussy: Images Book II - II. Et la lune descend sur le temple qui fut
    - Debussy: Images Book II - III. Poissons d'or
    - Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - I. Allegro marcato
    - Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - II. Presto misterioso
    - Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - III. Adagio molto appassionato
    - Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - IV. Ruvido ed ostinato

   I particularly like the Debussy.

**** Other Happy Notes

My other son Daniel is finishing out his junior year at Cedarville
from home.  Bryan's girlfriend (also graduating from Duquesne) will
again spend the summer doing something she loves, counting birds for
Bird Conservancy of the Rockies.  A "kid" I knew from scouting is
headed off for a masters in biomedical engineering this fall, and we
may hike together a week or two if possible in June or July.

Life goes on.   All is not doom and gloom.   There are some happy
notes.  Share some of yours?

I find that when I stay glued to twitter (pick your
social-media-of-doom-amplifier) I tend to get a rather gloomy view of
life.  There is indeed a lot one can be gloomy about these days.  But
if you just go for a walk and look around you may be
surprised:

I found this art [[pic:sidewalk-art][sidewalk art]] at just about the exact place where last

least that's how it goes in Virginia)

I have [[pic:grass][full luscious grass]] (that has to be mowed).  This may not happen
again:

And last but not least I saw a bird I don't think I've seen before,
it turned out to be a common [[pic:tree-swallow][tree swallow]], but it was startling to see
the almost metallic, shinny dark blue back and white belly (the

    I was on email as early as 1980 on a DEC20. I was on Usenet news
    when it was the digital frontier and on the Internet in the
    mid-80s, 10 years or so before the Web.  I helped bring America
    online working at CompuServe before America Online existed.  I
    quit Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 election as it got too
    political and now I find that my main digital platform (Twitter)
    is home to the daily, um, ?sophisms? of the President who spawned
    the political rhetoric I fled.

    Is it time to move on?  Time to find another avant-guard tech hole
    to clime into?  Thanks to the Internet there are infinitely more
    options than just the dial-up BBS systems of the early 80s.

    I was a little sad to loose contact with all the elementary school
    friends that Facebook enabled me to reconnect with after 40 years
    (OK, not really) and I would be sad too loose touch with the zany
    [[https://twitter.com/search?q=%2523classicstwitter&src=typed_query][#ClassicsTwitter]] crowd ([[https://twitter.com/aeneasgoogling][aeneasgoogling apud elysium]] I'm looking at

A few years ago, my mother went through the effects of her cousin
after she died.  It turns out Thelma Jane wrote poetry.  Nobody knew.
It wound up in the trash.

Thelma lived alone.  Her husband had died in his 40s.  They had no
children. Her mother, my great-aunt Bess, lived to 102 and took her
first motorcycle ride at 100.  My mom had to go through Thelma's stuff
and Aunt Bess' stuff, most of which Thelma still had.  I now have some
of the leftovers.  But nobody wanted the poetry.  So it's gone.

This brings me to the question this article explores: /why write/?

#100daystooffload #whywrite #poetry

#+hugo: more

  - Permanence? :: Thelma's poetry is gone.  Even names carved on
    tombstones crumble with time.  If your writing is very good (see,
    e.g., Virgil and Cicero) and you're lucky (see scribes in Celtic
    monasteries) your scribblings on paper, velum or in cyberspace
    might last the centuries and inspire other writers (see Dante).

  - Therapy? ::  I've been journaling (on paper) for a month or so.   I find
    the process quite creative and even cathartic.  And there is
    something freeing about being able to scribble, erase, underline,
    circle, draw arrows from one idea to the next, and in processing
    information a non-linear fashion.  Unexpected connections can be
    made.  I'm a huge fan of [[https://orgmode.org/][emacs org mode]] (this blog post is being
    written in org mode exported using [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] to export a [[https://gohugo.io/][hugo]] static
    web site hosted on [[https://pages.github.com/][Github pages]], but even using the best of
    digital writing tools, there is something not quite as free about
    it.  There is something mentally relaxing about writing on paper
    (and going for long walks).

  - Learning? :: You learn by doing.  The process of writing (can)
    help you organize thoughts.  You often have to research things.
    Putting ideas out there opens you up to criticism.  You have to
    defend or modify your position.   It can be a starting point for
    conversation.

  - Social Connections? :: See Facebook, Twitter, et al.  For all
    their downsides, there is no denying that writing, even the at the
    banal and everyday level of much of "social media" generates
    connections.   I prefer to think it will allow me to maintain
    meaningful connections to people who are important to me in life,
    but my writing may not, in fact, be that noble.

  - Hubris? :: Pride?  Vanity?  Self-importance?  Self-absorption?
    These are all possibilities.

  - Professional Reasons? :: I sometimes write on professional topics, see
    [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/cybersecurity-and-bears/][Bears Attacks and Cybersecurity]]  and [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/reproducable-security-analytics/][Reproducable Security Analytics]].
    A mix of the same motivations is often in play.

  - To kill time? :: In this busy world we don't often feel that we
    have time to kill.  We don't sit on our front porch watching the
    world go by (and, in fact, it's been a hundred years or so since
    the front porch featured prominently in residential architecture,
    at least in the USA.), and even Baseball, the "national pass-time"
    is looking for ways to speed up the game for a public that has
    lost patience.   Maybe we need to slow down and focus on important
    things, or just enjoyable things.   Writing may be one of those
    things.

  - A habit? :: For some people, writing is a habit.  I think that may
    be one of the goals of the [[https://100daystooffload.com/][#100DaysToOffload concept]].  I'm going
    to give it a try.  Thanks [[https://kevq.uk/][Kev Quirk]]


I'll never know why Thelma Jane wrote her poetry.  I'm still trying to
figure out why I write.  Maybe it's one of the reasons discussed
above.  Maybe it's all of them.

of amazing software which helped set the stage for the Web.

  Steve worked at CompuServe (and successors) from 1970 to 2001.  I
  was fortunate enough to start my career working with/for him.  My
  view of his programming output comes largely from 1985-1995.  I'm
  sure there was much more that I missed.

**** Things Steve Wrote
  Steve ran the languages and tools group when I arrived.  /He had just/
  /given up on writing at DEC10 ADA compiler/[fn:2] (Steve is still writing
  ADA software), was just beginning to embrace PCs as "real computers"
  worthy of his attention, had written a FORTRAN compiler, a BASIC
  compiler and associated run-time systems, and a run-time library for
  BLISS called BTOOLS.  These were partially in support of
  CompuServe's pre-information-service time-sharing services supported
  by a homegrown packet-switched networking.  "Cloud computing" in the
  1970s :-)

  I worked on BTOOLS, SKIMAN (Single Key Index Access Manager), a
  B-Tree library Steve had created.  There was a full-fledged database
  system written in there somewhere I think.  There were ports and
  hacks to various tools such as FINE (Fine Is Not Emacs), a C
  compiler, DEC Runoff, laser printer support, source code control
  systems, etc.

  On top of that, Steve created the HMI (Host Micro Interface)
  protocol that rode on top of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b_protocol][CompuServe "B-Protocol"]] to allow API
  driven interactions with the information service (the alternative
  being text/command line interfaces).  This was all in an environment
  where 9600baud modems were considered "fast".  Compression,
  incremental display, etc. were paramount.

  He later used that as the substrate for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compuserve_information_manager][WinCim]], the graphical interface
  to the information service that he created which kept the company
  going for a while in the face of the likes of AOL.  Somewhere in
  there, there was a graphics library and enough pieces that I was
  able to write a web browser that worked inside WinCim, that would
  have allowed CompuServe users without an Internet connection (most
  everyone then) to browse the web.  Marketing did not want to release
  my web browser.  *Sigh*.

  Later on (after my time) Steve as pulled into major projects to support
  the back end processing for H&R Blocks's TaxCut program when online
  tax-filing was a new thing.  /He was also pulled into the WOW project/
  /which was supposed to be the AOL killer when it became apparent that/
  /CompuServe needed an AOL killer./[fn:3]  One of those projects succeeded.
  Single-handed technical virtuosity could not fix the one that
  didn't.

  And there was this little side project called GIF.

**** Things that got out

***** GIF
  Be careful what you do and say.  It's often the incidentals that you
  are remembered for.  The kind (or unkind) words.  The side projects.

  In the world of the mid 80s there were IBM PCs, Apple Macs
  (classic), Amigas, Atari-STs, CoCos, and yes, Apple-IIs and
  Commodor-68s.  The information service was moving beyond a
  text-based, menu-driven system (I like curses and termcap as much as
  the next guy, but hey..).  People wanted to share pictures, display
  online-shopping catalogs, weather maps, etc.  There were no/few good
  portable graphics formats.  So Steve wrote one.  GIF.  Then the web happened.
  The web wanted portable images too.  GIF worked.  So the early web
  adopted it.  There was the kerfuffle over the LZW compression
  algorithm it used resulting in the creation of the PNG format, but,
  hey, who in 1987 would ever think that an algorithm published in ACM
  might not be free.  OK, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_stallman][Stallman]], but who else :-).  And now there
  are Giffy's in slack that I turn off because I hate dancing bears.
  Thank-you Steve.

**** MicroEmacs/mg display hacks

  And then there are the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MicroEmacs][MiroEmacs]] display hacks.  When the Amiga came
  out Steve convinced me to buy one (it was that or the AtariST, he
  had and was hacking on both).  But there was no Emacs.  Somehow
  (Steve?) I became aware that the source to MicroEmacs was included
  on with the disks to Mark Williams C compiler for the PC.  So I bought
  the C compiler, ported the source to the Amiga (all it needed was
  character I/O drivers to work in the native ANSI/VT-100 terminal)
  and gave the source to Steve, who, I think, hacked/improved the
  screen update logic.  I then posted the source to the USENET group
  comp.sources.amiga. It took off from there (thanks to Daniel
  Lawerence).  It's rumored that Linus Torvalds uses a version of the
  code to this day.


**** CompuServe: Groundbreaking events, great teams and amazing individuals.

     At the recent (2019-10-19) CompuServe 50th Anniversary reunion I
     was reminded of the revolutionary things that happened there: the
     first commercial email, the first online banking, the first
     online shopping, the first electronic news wire feed, the first
     song released exclusively online (Arrowsmith 1994), online chat
     (CB), OS and compiler development, VPNs (X.25 !), data over cable
     in 82....and Dan Piskur inventing what we know today as much of
     standard online security, incident response and "cyber"/law
     enforcement collaboration, all before the Internet.

     Of course it all took the efforts of many people and groups:  the
     network software team (packet switching c.a. 1972, take that
     DARPA), the "monitor group" (TOPS-10 OS development),
     MicroComputer Software (terminal emulators forever !), large
     systems software (billing et. al.), and of course the genius of
     the founders (John Goltz) and the vision of Jeff Wilkins (CEO
     1970-1985).

     There's a lot to be said for being in the right place at the
     right time, and for having a team, but many things do not happen
     without the essential contributions of amazing individuals.

     Thanks Steve.

**** Footnotes

[fn:2] Steve corrected me.  There were never actually plans to write
an Ada compiler.  But I was unaware of the XBASIC compiler.   So 3
compilers in all.

[fn:3] Steve informs me he was NOT pulled into the WOW project.  Maybe
the outcome would have been better if he had...


[fn:1] yes, there are many better tools for this job, but not in the constrained environment where this had to run.


*** WIP HOWTO: Using Pi-hole DNS to block ads.  The struggle continues... :DNS:privacy:networking:HOWTO:

/This article is a work in progress.  Updated: 2020-05-02.  This is
turning into a bit of a catch-up on the state of DNS for me./

Day 03 and 04 of #100DaysToOffload.

**** Intro
# Thanks to Paul Vixie for the pointer to

The war against ads continues. https://pi-hole.net/ looks like a
reasonable, good, new?, open source entry in the war against ads. Get
'yer source/install for linux at https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole

Per Paul Vixie
#+begin_quote
not even non-technical users need a "public DNS" to shield themselves
from a lot of known-evil internet sites. check out @The_Pi_Hole or
have your 12yo child or cousin install it.
#+end_quote

..but I always make things harder.

**** What
     - It's a local DNS server to block adds.

**** Why
     - Blocking ads is a moral good.
     - I've not done home network hacking for a while.
     - I'm moving into a bit of a more "don't track me" frame of mind.

**** When
     - Now, because I'm home more during corona-virus.

**** How
     - Set up local server.
     - First on a Linux laptop that (usually) does not go off the net.
     - Then maybe on an old pogoplug or laptop.

**** Install It

     Here's what I did to instlal

     - [ ]  basic install :: On a Linux server, the *basic* install is
       simple:

       #+begin_example
       sudo bash basic-install.sh
       #+end_example

     - [ ] Static IP :: But you will want a Linux box with a static IP
       address. This may involve, e.g., convincing your wireless
       router to hand out a the same static IP to a static IP

     - [ ] Tell other systems to use this IP for DNS :: Again,
       probably configuring your wireless router to specify your local
       IP as the DNS server for DNS assignments via DHCP assignments.
       You could also do this by configuring the individual devices to
       use it.

     - [ ] Remember your admin password :: Make note of the admin password during install

     - [ ] hit the local admin web server :: Its a very nice.  It will
       be at a something like  http://192.168.86.230/admin/index.php.

**** Test It

     - [ ] Look something up by hand :: Use dig(1) or host(1).  Note
       the =SERVER= in the response below that shows where the answer
       came from.  If it's your IPS's DNS or Google, try again
       (something's not configured right).  In my case 127.1 is right.

     #+begin_example
$ dig www.uu.net

; <<>> DiG 9.11.3-1ubuntu1.11-Ubuntu <<>> www.uu.net

     #+end_example

     - [ ] Check the query logs via the UI to make sure your target domain
       showed.   Be aware of caching.  It may only show up the first
       time you query.

     - [ ] Go trolling for ads :: Find your favorite 90s-era web site,
       go hit it, and watch the counters

       + http://computershopper.com
       + http://www.yahoo.com
       + http://www.compuserve.com
       + http://www.aol.com
       + http://sears.com (get it while it lasts)

     - If the counters go crazy and you don't see the expected
       plethora of ads, you win.  If not dig deeper.

     - If you are all-ready using ad-dblockers :: If you are already
       using ad-blockers or browsers such as Brave that block ads, you
       may have to test with something else (Firefox, Chrome, etc.)

     - Browser and other apps are getting cagey about using not using
       the system DNS, using DOH, and otherwise not acting like you
       expect them too.  Editing =/etc/resolv.conf= is not the whole
       game anymore.

**** Tools you may want to use/learn/install
     - dig :: for making/testing queries by hand
     - [[https://www.wireshark.org/][Wireshark]] :: Use Wireshark to see what's going on on the wire,
       who you're talking to, etc.
**** The things you learn
     - pi-hole can apparently function as a DHCP server itself.

     - You can choose your upstream DNS servers from a list with
       options for IPv4, IPv6, DNSSEC/no DNSSEC, filtered/unfiltered.

    - Quad9 is one of the choices.  It looks to be really useful for
      adding malware blocking to your domain.  See
      https://www.quad9.net/faq/ for a useful bit of education.


    - The logs are at =/var/log/pihole.log=

    - Possibly use [[http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/papers/ai/][Marcus Ranums's principal of "Artificial Ignorance"]]
      to grep out the known and see what's left:

      What is this stuff?

**** Tune it
     I'm not sure all the devices in the house are using the P-hole
     proxy.  If they are, then they are showing up as the single
     device _gateway.   I need to understand this and figure out if I
     can get other devices pulling wireless addresses via DHCP from
     the WAP to use the Pi-hole DNS directly.   Stay tuned.

**** POST INCOMPLETE FROM HERE

**** Migrate

**** Burn in
