**** PUBLISHED Fixing GNU bash associative array insert speed :programming:gnu:linux:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: 20200418
:EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE: 2020-04-18:
:END:

Bash uses linear search to insert values in to associative arrays.
This is all well and good for small numbers of keys.   I was adding
millions[fn:1].    I went poking around the bash source code today
(2020-04-18) to confirm my suspicion and gauge the difficulty of
adding an option to do something more sensible.

In less than a day after I reported it, there is a patch
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2020-04/msg00114.html My
timing code and pre and post patch timings are here:
https://github.com/eludom/snippits/tree/master/bash/tests

#+hugo: more

Here the steps I took and where I might go if I get serious about
fixing the problem:

***** Get the source code

****** Find it
- find the homepage :: A quick bit of googling lead to the homepage http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/bash/
- use git :: For a minute it looked like GNU was still stuck in the bad old
     days of having to download a tarball and then apply a series
     of patches, but fortunately, it there is a git repo http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=bash
****** Download it
#+begin_src bash :eval no
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/bash.git
#+end_src
****** Build it

Bash follows a time honored build convention
#+begin_src bash :results output :eval no
./configure
make
#+end_src

****** Analyze it
- I read the NEWS file for any indication that associative arrays
  has been worked on to speed up associative array
  insert/look-ups.  No indication that they had.
- I checked the git commit logs, which appear to be meaningful
  after Bash-4.4 patch 19.  Nothing.
- With judicious use of grep ("grep-find in Emacs") for
  "associative" and "hash_search" it turns out that associative
  array inserts (as all inserts) are done with use of the
  "hash_search" function in =hashlib.c=
- has_insert() begins as follows:
#+begin_src C
/* Create an entry for STRING, in TABLE.  If the entry already
   exists, then return it (unless the HASH_NOSRCH flag is set). */
BUCKET_CONTENTS *
hash_insert (string, table, flags)
     char *string;
     HASH_TABLE *table;
     int flags;
{
  BUCKET_CONTENTS *item;
  int bucket;
  unsigned int hv;

  if (table == 0)
    table = hash_create (0);

  item = (flags & HASH_NOSRCH) ? (BUCKET_CONTENTS *)NULL
                               : hash_search (string, table, 0);
#+end_src
- and there it is, the linear search walking the list in
  =hash_search()=
#+begin_src C
/* Return a pointer to the hashed item.  If the HASH_CREATE flag is passed,
   create a new hash table entry for STRING, otherwise return NULL. */
BUCKET_CONTENTS *
hash_search (string, table, flags)
     const char *string;
     HASH_TABLE *table;
     int flags;
{
  BUCKET_CONTENTS *list;
  int bucket;
  unsigned int hv;

  if (table == 0 || ((flags & HASH_CREATE) == 0 && HASH_ENTRIES (table) == 0))
    return (BUCKET_CONTENTS *)NULL;

  bucket = HASH_BUCKET (string, table, hv);

  for (list = table->bucket_array ? table->bucket_array[bucket] : 0; list; list = list->next)
    {
      /* This is the comparison function */
      if (hv == list->khash && STREQ (list->key, string))
        {
          list->times_found++;
          return (list);
        }
    }
#+end_src


***** Next steps
****** DONE Reach out to the maintainers
see if they would even entertain the idea of a patch
****** CANCELED Look for appropriate in-memory hash insert/lookup functions
- btrees ?
****** CANCELED Code it
****** CANCELED test it
****** CANCELED submit patch
See https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2020-04/msg00114.html

[fn:7] ADS stands for "Attention Distraction Syndrome"

[fn:1] yes, there are many better tools for this job, but not in the constrained environment where this had to run.

**** WIP HOWTO: Using Pi-hole DNS to block ads.  The struggle continues... :DNS:privacy:networking:HOWTO:

/This article is a work in progress.  Updated: 2020-05-02.  This is
turning into a bit of a catch-up on the state of DNS for me./

Day 03 and 04 of #100DaysToOffload.

***** Intro
# Thanks to Paul Vixie for the pointer to

The war against ads continues. https://pi-hole.net/ looks like a
reasonable, good, new?, open source entry in the war against ads. Get
'yer source/install for linux at https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole

Per Paul Vixie
#+begin_quote
not even non-technical users need a "public DNS" to shield themselves
from a lot of known-evil internet sites. check out @The_Pi_Hole or
have your 12yo child or cousin install it.
#+end_quote

..but I always make things harder.

#+hugo: more

***** What
- It's a local DNS server to block adds.

***** Why
- Blocking ads is a moral good.
- I've not done home network hacking for a while.
- I'm moving into a bit of a more "don't track me" frame of mind.

***** When
- Now, because I'm home more during corona-virus.

***** How
- Set up local server.
- First on a Linux laptop that (usually) does not go off the net.
- Then maybe on an old pogoplug or laptop.

***** Install It

Here's what I did to instlal

- [ ] basic install :: On a Linux server, the *basic* install is
     simple:

     #+begin_example
                 sudo bash basic-install.sh
     #+end_example

- [ ] Static IP :: But you will want a Linux box with a static IP
     address. This may involve, e.g., convincing your wireless
     router to hand out a the same static IP to a static IP

- [ ] Tell other systems to use this IP for DNS :: Again,
     probably configuring your wireless router to specify your local
     IP as the DNS server for DNS assignments via DHCP assignments.
     You could also do this by configuring the individual devices to
     use it.

- [ ] Remember your admin password :: Make note of the admin password during install

- [ ] hit the local admin web server :: Its a very nice.  It will
     be at a something like  http://192.168.86.230/admin/index.php.

***** Test It

- [ ] Look something up by hand :: Use dig(1) or host(1).  Note
     the =SERVER= in the response below that shows where the answer
     came from.  If it's your IPS's DNS or Google, try again
     (something's not configured right).  In my case 127.1 is right.

#+begin_example
$ dig www.uu.net

#+end_example

- [ ] Check the query logs via the UI to make sure your target domain
  showed.   Be aware of caching.  It may only show up the first
  time you query.

- [ ] Go trolling for ads :: Find your favorite 90s-era web site,
     go hit it, and watch the counters

  - http://computershopper.com
  - http://www.yahoo.com
  - http://www.compuserve.com
  - http://www.aol.com
  - http://sears.com (get it while it lasts)

- If the counters go crazy and you don't see the expected
  plethora of ads, you win.  If not dig deeper.

- If you are all-ready using ad-dblockers :: If you are already
     using ad-blockers or browsers such as Brave that block ads, you
     may have to test with something else (Firefox, Chrome, etc.)

- Browser and other apps are getting cagey about using not using
  the system DNS, using DOH, and otherwise not acting like you
  expect them too.  Editing =/etc/resolv.conf= is not the whole
  game anymore.


***** Tools you may want to use/learn/install
- dig :: for making/testing queries by hand
- [[https://www.wireshark.org/][Wireshark]] :: Use Wireshark to see what's going on on the wire,
     who you're talking to, etc.
***** The things you learn
- pi-hole can apparently function as a DHCP server itself.

- You can choose your upstream DNS servers from a list with
  options for IPv4, IPv6, DNSSEC/no DNSSEC, filtered/unfiltered.
- Quad9 is one of the choices.  It looks to be really useful for
  adding malware blocking to your domain.  See
  https://www.quad9.net/faq/ for a useful bit of education.


- The logs are at =/var/log/pihole.log=

- Possibly use [[http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/papers/ai/][Marcus Ranums's principal of "Artificial Ignorance"]]
  to grep out the known and see what's left:

  What is this stuff?

***** Tune it
I'm not sure all the devices in the house are using the P-hole
proxy.  If they are, then they are showing up as the single
device _gateway.   I need to understand this and figure out if I
can get other devices pulling wireless addresses via DHCP from
the WAP to use the Pi-hole DNS directly.   Stay tuned.

**** PUBLISHED "My Computer ?"   :computers:windows:apple:cloud:ubuntu:linux:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-computer
:EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE: 2020-05-12
:END:

The windows desktop has (had? I don't pay attention) icons labeled
"My Computer".  I always thought that was odd, or at least very
often out of context as many (most?) instances of Windows ran on
machines at people's jobs.  They didn't own the computer.  It was
not "My Computer".

Similarly, Apple has a long history of asserting they know what's
best for other people and their computers.  The last time I had to
go to "The Apple Store" all I wanted was a power cable.  I wanted
the part, I wanted to pay, I wanted to get out.  But,
characteristically, the "experts" there (what does that say about
their view of their customers) wanted to engage me, to "have a
conversation", talk to me about warranties and if I qualified, they
wanted to wast my time (more valuable than my money) on their
agenda.  Apple software is the same way.   Not "My Computer".

Then there is the cloud.  "There is no cloud, there's just other
people's computers."  I've worked at AWS.  I worked at CompuServe
about 5 years into the information service days.  Before that, it
was a time-sharing company.  "There is no isolated Project,
Programmer Number environment with custom BASIC and FORTRAN
Compilers, InfoPlex (email), and FILGE (FILe Generator and Editor)
connected via X.25 PADs (VPNs back in the day), there's just
CompuServe's DecSystem-10s."

And then there is this glorious 3 or 4 year old laptop that I'm
about to blow up, wiping the disk and reinstalling Ubuntu
(switching to Kubntu, because, why not?).  No change control.  No
production concerns (well, maybe a few, I'm putting out this blog
post early in case it does not come back quickly).  I have a long
running game of naming my systems.  This one's currently called ed
(for the editor), octo (8 processors), mel (for "real
programmers").  I think when I reinstall this time, I'll call it
"MyComputer".

#+hugo: more

***** Potential ox-hugo sites to copy
****** The Art Of Not Asking Why
I started by looking for sample web sites to copy by perusing
the sites on this list
https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/examples/

I found the following

- Site :: https://joshrollinswrites.com/
- Source :: https://github.com/jarss/TAONAW/tree/master

Josh has been great in answering the odd question.  His blog is
interesting too !!!  He accepts paypal...

***** General Info on Hugo, Ox-Hugo and github pages
Then I did some reading (this is where the /not simple/ part
comes in) on the following sites

- hugo getting started :: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/
- hosting a blog on github pages :: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/
- github pages :: https://pages.github.com/
- HOWTO with Hugo and github pages :: https://medium.com/swlh/hosting-a-hugo-blog-on-github-pages-with-travis-ci-e74a1d686f10
- Org mode hugo exporter :: https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/
  - I'll probably go here, but it seems like a bit much to start...
  - Maybe learn the un-automated way first?
- About Hugo :: https://people.umass.edu/weikaichen/post/emacs-ox-hugo/
- About blogging with Hugo :: https://www.shanesveller.com/blog/2018/02/13/blogging-with-org-mode-and-ox-hugo/

***** The results

You're looking at the results: https://eludom.github.io/, this
and other posts.  It took a couple deep dives to understand it,
but I think I more-or-less have it, and it is a very seamless
integration wtih Org-Mode, which for some of us closes the deal
even if there is pain involved

***** Bonus: Twitter cards

And for bonus points I did reading on how to add twitter card
support to ox-hugo bog posts, e.g., so you can write your post
and have twitter or other sites (such as [[https://mastodon.social/about][Mastadon]]) that
understand the format pull the title, intro and possibly an
image to post in the web sit.

****** Twitter Cards: HOWTO, the short story

Short version: if you drop =twitter_cards.html= in
=layouts/partials/= of your blog, you then just write your
blog, publish it, and past the URL into the https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
to make sure it's going to work when posted

****** Twitter Cards: More than you ever wanted to know, the long story.

- Twitter Cards :: https://sproutsocial.com/insights/twitter-cards/

***** How to publish: files, settings, process
And, finally the gory details of actually publishing.

These are raw/WIP notes, but mostly right.  They actually
publish this blog.

****** Important Files and Directories
- /home/gmj/public/github/ox-hugo-blogs/blog/curious.org :: The one file to rule them all
     o This is the blog.  All articles live in this one file as
     separate org trees.   This is the "source".
- HUGO_BASE_DIR=/home/gmj/public/github/ox-hugo-blogs/blog :: The root of my blog
     o This is the root/source for the blog.  It gets pushed to
     git@github.com:eludom/blog.git (fetch)
- =${HUGO_BASE_DIR}/content/= :: Where local content (markdown) goes,
     e.g. =content/posts/steve.md=
- =${HUGO_BASE_DIR}/docs/= :: Where the content to publish (html) goes,

****** Settings and Organization
******* Set EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION
In the .org file that is the blog, set EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION
to be "Blog" (or in whichever section you want posts to land,
default is "posts")

This is inherited lower level headers in org so

#+begin_example
,** Blog
   :PROPERTIES:
   :EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: Blog
   :EXPORT_FILE_NAME:
   :EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE:
   :END:
#+end_example

covers things in

#+begin_example
,* Content
,** Blog
,*** Work Stuff
,*** PUBLISHED Choosy Programmers Choose GIF :Wilhite:CompuServe:GIF:History:Computers:Emacs:Programming:
#+end_example

****** Processes
******* Drafting
******** TODO start hugo in root directory
=hugo server -D=
******** TODO Edit curious.org

Add an entry like this

#+begin_example
,*** WIP Walled Gardens
    :PROPERTIES:
    :EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION: Blog
    :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: walled-gardens
    :EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE: 2020-08-11
    :END:

    This is a brain dump on something like 40 years experience with
    "social media" of various forms.
#+end_example

- EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION :: probably not needed if inherited from
     higher level headline
- EXPORT_FILE_NAME :: The file name for this post.   Could be date.
- EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE :: Set to the date this post should be
     "live".  Can be used to schedule "future" posts.

- IMPORTANT :: Posts with a status of TODO are drafts.  WIP or
     PUBLISHED are "live"

- EVEN MORE IMPORTANT :: /A valid Hugo post subtree is an Org
     subtree that has the EXPORT_FILE_NAME property set./  ox-hugo
     only exports valid subtrees to markdown.  You can draft to your
     hearts content in subtrees that do not have EXPORT_FILE_NAME set
     (and maybe export the subtree to text or html to view)

******** TODO Save
With point in the newly created or updated subtree, save the file.
******** TODO view at http://localhost:1313/
view the drafts http://localhost:1313/
View the result in your browser
******* Publishing
******** run hugo
In the HUGO_BASE_DIR run =hugo=.  The results will be written to
"doc/".
******** push to github
- I host on github.io.
#+begin_example
      cd doc
      git add -A
      git commit -m"name of new post"
      git push
#+end_example
******* make sure post is live, looks right
- Go to site: https://eludom.github.io/
- It often takes a minute or so after push for things to show up
  on the web site.  You might have to refresh
******* Add and push the source
#+begin_example
        cd ..
        git status .
        git add [new files]
        git commit -m"name of new post"
#+end_example

- be sure not to add docs/, as that is pushed a a subtree.
- possibly move the docs/ tree so that is not subsidiary to the root

***** Conclusion
"I mean, why not just use blogger.com or Wordpress"?  Been
there done that.

Companies come and go.  I ought to know.  I started my career
working at CompuServe.  The forums where apparently finally
deleted on 2017.  History was lost.

There are issues of control.  There are the issues of using
tools I like, not the GUI or "download my app" du jour with
tracking, ads, monetization, bloat and more.

You can type ed commands (see below) and they work.  "vi" is the
"visual interface" to ed (or one of it's successors).  Though I am a
die hard ~emacs~ user, often when I just want to do a quick edit or take
some note I just fire up =/bin/ed= and go....

     Source code distribution has changed over the years.  Today we
     all love (hate?) git, github and friends, but, believe it or not
     there were ways to distribute source code even before the
     Internet.  In fact, this was the world in which the GNU Public
     License was created. Below are a few of the ways I've
     gotten/transferred source code through the years, in something

     Post 31 of #100DaysToOffload https://100daystooffload.com/

     #+hugo: more


     - Print Outs ::  Paper.  Yes, paper.  My first memories of source
       code (late 70s) include source listing of BASIC programs
       printed on ASR-33 Teletypes.  I also have memories of a large
       stack of "green bar" printouts at home (again, c.a. 78 or 79)
       that I think where the printouts of Emacs (TECO emacs, the
       original, before GNU) that my brother probably brought home
       from Carnegie-Mellon where he went as an undergrad.

     - Paper Tape :: The ASR-33s had paper tape punches on the side.
       You could punch your programs onto tape and read them back in.
       It was 8-bit ASCII.   At one point, I think my brother could
       read the ASCII by looking at the tape.

     - Cards :: Early in college (80, 81) I actually punched cards for
       a class or two.  You could duplicate cards.   No cheating on
       that programming assignment now !

     - BYTE Magazine :: Gamers of yore bought BYTE Magazine (and
       others), in part to get the source code listings that they
       could then type in.

     - ACM, Knuth :: And of course there were textbooks such as Kunths
       (to this day unfinished) "The Art of Computer Programming" and
       ACM publications.  Steve Wilhite used an algorithm published in
       ACM as part of GIF...of course anything printed was in the
       public domain, right? ... well, no.  We were all still learning
       about and in some cases defining the legal status of software
       then, right along with GNU/FSF.


     - USENET News  :: In the late 80s, MIT project Athena periodically posted
       the source code to X-Windows to the USENET news group
       comp.sources.x.  If you were on a USENET site that "took a
       feed" of that newsgroup (usually over modems not faster than
       9600baud), to get the latest source to X, you watched the news
       group (using readnews, rn or some other "newsreader" program),
       saved off the individual pieces from each post, reassembled and
       then extracted the code.  The (large) distro was compressed and
       broken up into many pieces, and re-assembling them often
       involved the use of uudecode, shar, patch, tar, and programs to
       decompress (pretty sure gzip was not a thing yet).  Of course,
       you had to grab them before your news site expired the articles
       (spool space was limited, and space was shared with
       rec.humor.funny and other essential news groups).  Heaven help
       you if you missed one piece.  No bit-torrent for you to find
       the missing pieces.  You got one shot from one source in a
       limited time window.

     - UUCP :: UUCP being "unix to unix copy", you could literally
       issue a copy command of source known to live on a remote system
       something like

       #+begin_example
       uucp cbosgd!/archive/hdb-uucp.tar.gz hdb-uucp.tar.gz
       #+end_example

       with multi-hop paths being possible...if you knew the topology
       (pathalias !) and the filenames.

     - mag tape :: Then there was the time I was in Boston (visiting
       Encore computer?).   I took a blank 9-track tape, arranged to
       stop by MIT, was given a personal tour of the labs, show the
       locked room where the all-important KDC (forerunner of
       Microsoft's domain controllers) was kept, and got a copy of the
       latest Athena source (X, Kerberos, Hesiod, etc.) dumped to
       tape. This was getting software, the easy way.

     - DECUS tapes ::  Tapes were a thing for quite a while.  early on
       users of DEC computers created and distributed "decus tapes",
       which were user-contributed collections of software.  If the
       VAX/VMS bulletin board system I created in FORTRAN-77 around
       1983 exists anywhere in the world, it's probably in the archive
       of DECUS tapes.  This is one example of collections of
       user-generated software that grew into the software archives we
       came to know later.  I think the IBM SHARE user group had
       similar collections.  The programs (games, etc) distributed
       with BSD Unix formed another set.  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DistroWatch][DistroWatch]] is one web site
       in this vein today.

     - Floppies :: With the advent of the PC (early, mid 80s) floppies
       became a thing.  I purchased a copy of the Mark Williams C
       compiler for DOS just to get the public-domain source to
       MicroEmacs which I then ported to the Amiga.  Of course, with
       floppies came boot sector viruses and the security wars were
       on.  Later issues of BYTE sometimes shipped with floppies of
       source so you didn't have to type it in.

     - Email :: Yes, you could always use tar, shar(1), uuencode(1)
       and friends to email source code.   Email has been a workhorse
       for something like 40 years, not just for communication but as
       the file transfer method of last (first?) resort.

     - CompuServe (and other) Forums :: I ran ("SYSOPed" the
       CompuServe Unix Forum for a few years.  I think we/I may have
       invented the file suffix ".tgz" to stand for "gzip tar" archive
       (because the forums could not deal with multiple suffixes, as
       in .tar.gz).  We had source code available for download.  The
       Forums were just CompuServe's version of the local dial-up BBS
       and many other similar message/download systems.

     - FTP :: As Internet connectivity started becoming common (at
       least in universities, government and some larger
       corporations), a number of "well known" FTP sites where created
       (often at well connected UUCP sites) that collected and offered
       source downloads. UUNET and WUSTL (Washington Univerity at
       St. Louis) being some of the larger ones (there is still a
       version of FTP server software, wu-ftp available for Linux)

     - Source Code Control Systems :: As Internet connectivity became
       a thing, source code control systems such as cvs, svn,
       mercurial and friends started being used on local networks and
       it became possible to use them over the Internet.  They also
       solved a lot of the collaboration, version control and release
       management issues that are important for projects of any size.

     - SourceForge :: Sourceforge gets honorable mention as a
       precursor to github and friends.  In the early 2000s it hosted
       many open source projects.  I initially hosted NCAT there which
       became the Center for Internet Security's Router Audit Tool.

     - "My name is Legion, for we are many" ::  Git is a good thing.
       Really.  Today we have github, gitlab, dropbox and thousands of
       other options for getting and sharing source code, some of
       which even work reasonably well.

     The world has changed. It really is a better place. No more
     trolling the USENET News feed spool.  No more trips to MIT, tape
     in hand.  No more hoping ftp.uu.net has the latest version.
     Go forth and hack.

On this Armistice Day, 2020, commemorating the end of "The war to end
all wars" 119 years ago, I reflect that if the whole world were busy
fiddling with their emacs configs there would be no more war.  Well...
so the treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations did not work out
as planned...so maybe we look for community in the small instead.

There is community that has grown out of research labs in Boston (a
city notable for its contribution to the birth of other well known
communities).  Some of the well known members of the community that I
am acquainted with include a Chinese programmer living in Palo Alto, a
philosophy major in France, an Astronomy professor in the
Netherlands, a programmer in New Zealand, a Fin living in the United
states and a Filipina mother of a 4 year old living in Canada and of
course it's founder, still in Boston.

***** What is this and why was it written?
      This is my personal history of putting
      words-on-page-or-screen-or-blog-entry covering the period from
      the late 1970s to present (2020-12-05).

      It was written (partially) at the request of [[https://helpdeskheadesk.net/about/][JTR]] from
      whom I borrowed a Hugo blog theme.  Thanks JTR.

      I was writing a post where I wanted to include the $\TeX$ symbol
      in the post, which is perfectly possible in emacs org mode where
      $\TeX$ and $\LaTeX$ are first class citizens, but it wasn't
      working.

      The blog exports to markdown via the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] Org exporter back
      end (lost yet?)  which [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] then translates to HTML which can
      then be previewed locally with Hugo's own web server and then
      pushed to the live site, in my case, this site using git push.

      I pinged JTR who, it turns out had little experience with
      $\LaTeX$ and so was not able to help.  Along the way, he asked
      me

      #+begin_quote
      Is there more you can tell me about use case for it? In other words,
      can I get you to vent some more about this, it's interesting.
      #+end_quote

      #+hugo: more


      So here is some venting. I can always vent. And, in case you were wondering, the
      solution is to put

***** Some History

      Marley was dead, to begin with...
      #+end_quote

      No. No. No.

      #+begin_quote
      It was a dark and stormy night...
      #+end_quote

      Wrong.

      OK, how about this:

***** Dad - Typewriters
      #+begin_quote
      In high school I wrote out my paper assignments by hand and then my
      Dad typed them for me, at least until I took typing and got up to
      30wpm.  White-out can be your friend :-)
      #+end_quote

      Better.

      #+begin_quote
      As high school progressed I and my friends started using the
      HP-2000E in the computer lab on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_Model_33][ASR 33 Teletypes]] (=/dev/tty=
      anyone?) that printed your input and the computers responses on
      a role of paper.  We may have printed a few stories or other
      prose, but mostly it was BASIC listings.

      Towards the end of high school, I remember eyeing the school
      secretary's IBM Selectric typewriter because we knew it could be
      converted to a printer...(Apple II's were all the rage then
      ...)
      #+end_quote


***** Brian Reid - Scribe
       So, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scribe_(markup_language)][Scribe]].  So in the late 70's at Carnegie-Mellon, Brian Reid
       stepped into the long tradition of Computer Science geeks scratching
       their own itch, developing one of the first mark-up languages
       that allowed the author to describe a document structurally
       (chapters, paragraph, et cetera.), and to target different output
       devices (text, laser printer, etc.), and to externalize styles,
       presaging the later CSS style sheets.

       Reid killed several birds with one stone.  Scribe was the
       subject of his PhD Thesis, it formatted his PhD thesis (and
       many others for a few years), and was sold to Unilogic sparking
       the first software copyright problems between CMU and students,
       wining Reid the ACM Grace Hopper Award, and, of course,
       criticism from Richard Stallman[fn:11] for not making it available for
       free...some people :-)

       I wound up using Scribe on the Ohio State DECsystem-20 and then
       being the SCRIBE administrator for the department of Mechanical
       Engineering for a year or two.  As I had access to
       then-world-class formatting and typesetting facilities, Dad was
       no longer typing my papers :-)

***** Donald Knuth - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX][TeX]]

      Meanwhile, on the other side of the country (on a dark and
      stormy night?), [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth][Donald Knuth]] was (and still is) engaged in
      writing his foundational series of Computer Science textbooks,
      /The Art of Computer Programming/ [fn:10].  But he was not happy with
      the appearance of the typesetting from his publisher, so, being
      Donald Knuth, he set out to write his own
      formatting and type-setting program c.a. 1978.  The result was
      $\TeX$. Along with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX][TeX]]  he developed Metafont, a language for
      describing fonts from which we get the Computer Modern fonts.

      The current $\TeX$ release is 3.14159265.   Each subsequent
      release adds a digit of $\pi$.   Metafont is at  2.7182818 and
      approaching /e/ with each release.

      I installed the Pascal based TeX82 on the DEC10's at
      CompuServe sometime around 1986.

***** Donald Knuth - Literate Programming

     Not content with having won the Turning award in 1974 (4 years
     prior), with creating a typesetting system that is used to this
     day for a large fraction of academic publishing, alongside
     $\TeX$ he came up with the concept of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][Literate Programming]], the
     basic idea of which is you are writing a program both for humans
     and machines.  The language was called WEB[fn:9].   The basic
     process is to run "weave" to generate output for humans (say, a
     volume of the /The Art of Computer Programming/) and to run
     "tangle" to generate output (code) for machines.

     We see elements of this today in Jupyter and Zeppelin notebooks,
     and for those of the Emacs-Org-mode faith, as the mix of [[https://orgmode.org/][Org
     Mode]] and [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/intro.html][Org Babel]].  See the paper by Domnick, Shculte etc on
     reproducible research: https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v046i03

     Org directly supports a form "tangle" today.

***** Guy Steele - the 1 degree of separation

      Guy Steele who later went on to have a lot to do with Java (and
      standardizing C) seems to have been the 1-degree-of-separation
      point for Emacs, TeX, and possibly SCRIBE.  As recently
      as https://emacsconf.org/2020/, Stallman credits Steele with
      helping invent Emacs.  Per Wikipedia, Steele spent the summer of
      78 at Stanford and later implemented a back-end for TeX at MIT.
      By 1980 or so (per my wife who knew him there) he was at CMU and
      Tartan Labs as Reid was finishing off SCRIBE and his thesis.
      The Stanford-Berkeley-MIT-CMU crowed was (is?) a small world.
      James Gosling (Java, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosling_Emacs][GosMacs]] 1981) was also kicking around CMU
      before moving off to Sun.

***** Leslie Lamport - Latex

      So, $\TeX$ was cool and all, but it was very low level, and in
      some ways difficult to work with.  People had seen SCRIBE.  So
      at some point in the mid-80s, as SCRIBE was on its way to
      proprietary-software-oblivion, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport][Leslie Lamport]] created $\LaTeX$.

      $\LaTeX$ is, from my point of view, a set of SCRIBE-like macros
      on top of $\TeX$.  Very useful.

      And because creators gonna create....along the way Lamport and
      Oren Patashink created [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX][BibTeX]] which is to this day one of the
      most common ways to keep a list of bibliographic references that
      can be cited in your papers.

      If you're curious what all this looks like, I keep my resume in
      .tex format[fn:13]. You can see it here
      http://www.port111.com/george/resume/ along with the .bib file
      for citations and .tex input.

***** Bill Gates and the nameless corporate droids[fn:12] - WYSIAYG Editors

      What You See Is All You Get (WYSIAYG) also known as What You See
      Is What You Get (WISIWYG) editors let you move pixels around on
      the screen and print exactly what you see.  With no training at
      all in printing, typesetting, aesthetics, or design you can make
      wildly inconsistent and incoherent decisions about the visual
      appearance of your document, in fact, you (and your boss and
      your marketing department) can focus on that from the start to
      the exclusion of stringing together coherent thoughts.

      I'm pretty sure SCRIBE and $\LaTeX$ form the basis of my
      antipathy to the WYSIWIG editors that started to come along
      (mass market).  When writing documents you should think first
      about what you are saying, the structure of your document, your
      arguments and your story line before you worry (if all) about
      making a font just the right size and color so you can make your
      power point.  Formatting should be the afterthought, and no
      more than choosing the right style sheet.  Brian Reed got that
      right.

***** Sir "Almost not appearing in this blog post" - RUNOFF and nroff
      A couple honorable mentions that I did in fact use a good bit
      along the way are [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TYPSET_and_RUNOFF][DEC RUNOFF]] (DEC 10s, VMS) and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nroff][nroff]] (unix).

      nroff comes in handy when you want to write man(1) pages.

***** Tim Berners-Lee - The Web
      There was a time before the web.  There were things written and
      published before the web.  But since the early 90s it's been the
      800-pound gorilla in the living room.

      There were other hyptertext systems before it.  Apple's
      HyperCard.  The GNU/Emacs info system.  There was, in fact, a
      whole academic conference on hypertext systems at which early
      versions of HTML/HTTP were scorned.

      But NCSA Mosaic happened, Netscape happened ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen][Marc Andreessen]]).
      The NCSA, Netscape and Apache servers happened.  For various
      reasons, the World Wide Web took off in ways that gopher never
      did and [[https://gemini.circumlunar.space/][Gemini]] probably never will.  Stodgy XML editors were
      rebranded as exciting new HTML editors.

      I attended the 2nd International Conference on Mosaic and the
      Web, met Berners-Lee, and implemented a never-released web
      browser that worked through CompuServe's WinCIM which would have
      allowed dial-up users without an IP stack such as SLIP or PPP
      (most users at that time) to access the web.  But marketing
      people.  They were not sure this web thing was going to catch
      on....

***** Carsten Dominick - Org Mode - "Your Life in Plain Text"
      Your blog post is text.  Your email it text.  Your slack (IRC)
      messages are text.  Your documents are text.  Your calendar and
      agenda are text.  Your shopping lists are text.  You TODO lists
      are text.  Musical scores are texts.  Poems are text.  ASCII art
      is text.  Source code is text.  Data is text (json).  The web is
      text (once you strip out all the graphics, videos, java and
      javascript...) At different levels YOU are text.  Your DNA
      sequence is a text.  The story of your life is a text.

      There was a period in the late 90s and early 2000s where Emacs
      (the text editor) kind of went into a lull.  Then two things
      happened: package managers (ELPA, MELPA, basically "apps" for
      emacs) and org mode.

      Org mode is a game changer.  It's going to take me to my grave
      or senility where I forget the meta-alt-control-shift-escape
      sequences needed to make the magic happen, whichever comes first.
      People are learning an arcane 44-year old editor just to use org
      mode (and the growing list of packages being built in/with round
      it).

      Org started as a simple text outline tool.  It enabled Abraham
      Lincoln to write a short, pithy, and memorable speech:

#+begin_src org
,* Hook
  Four score and seven years ago our fathers
  - brought forth on this continent, a new nation,
    o conceived in Liberty,
    o and dedicated to the proposition
      + that all men are created equal.
,** Body
   Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that
   nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long
   endure...
,*** Conclusion
    ...that government of the people, by the people, for the people,
    shall not perish from the earth.
#+end_src

     OK, maybe not.

     Carsten Dominick, the creator of Org, is an academic
     (Astronomy professor), he built in support for $\LaTeX$ from the
     beginning.  To use $\LaTeX$ in Org, you simply write latex
     and math equations exactly as you would for "normal" $\LaTeX$.
     If the back-end exporter (e.g. the $\LaTeX$ exporter or the HTML
     exporter) support $\LaTeX$, you just get your nicely formatted
     output for free

\begin{multline*}
p(x) = x^8+x^7+x^6+x^5
\end{multline*}

     Org documents can be easily exported to text (of course),
     $\LaTeX$, HTML, .ODF (Microsoft Word compatible) and scores of
     others.  Same input.  2 or 3 keystrokes.  Different output.

     Org naively supports TODO lists, outlines, agendas, planning (GTD
     and similar systems), note taking/knowledge capture, contact
     management, calendaring, spreadsheet-like calculations, literate
     programming and the list goes on.

     Same basic interface.  Same commands.  Not a mouse-over, click or
     graphical interface in sight (unless you want it) Just text, all
     the way down.

     And since it's just text, it can be handled with source code
     management tools (git) and of course your favorite text editor.

     There are mobile clients ([[https://github.com/orgzly/orgzly-android][see Orgzly]]) so you can simply push org
     text files to your phone with Dropbox or Syncthing and use them
     for TODO lists, quick note taking and journal entries, shopping
     lists, contact management, schedules, etc.

     Oh, and ASCII art is a thing...

        My father spent 25 years working for the Ohio Historical
        Society running the microfilm department.  A lot of that time
        was spent preserving the last remaining copies of 19th and
        20th newspapers that somebody found in Aunt Millie's attic at
        her estate sale.  Save for that, the daily history of Findlay,
        Cadiz, Yellow Springs, Lima and Barberton would have been
        completely lost.  He was preserving important texts.  He was
        preserving, in some cases, the only record of people's lives.
        People's lives matter.

        I began my professional career at CompuServe.  CompuServe had
        vibrant forums where there was lots of interaction, growth and
        history made.  All with text exchanges.   A couple years ago,
        most of that history was flushed because "there was no
        business case for preserving it."

        Companies come and go.  They should not be trusted to preserve
        important texts or to decide which texts are important.  Today
        Facebook and Twitter are censoring content.  How long will
        they be in business? When will they dump text you care about?

        Karl Voit has spelled this out very well in a blog post: [[https://karl-voit.at/2020/10/23/avoid-web-forums/][Don't
        Contribute Anything Relevant in Web Forums Like Reddit]]

        I am systematically moving my texts off "Big Internet".
        Facebook went (mostly in 2016, completely in 2020).  I've
        stopped posting to Twitter.  Dropbox is gone.  Github (which
        hosts this blog) is next.  Google in progress.  I helped
        create this world, but it's time for a course correction.
        Centralization and mediation of human interaction by
        organizations with nothing but a advertising-driven profit
        motive[fn:14] is a problem.  We need to move to systems that
        put people first.

        Having recently joined the Mastadon community Fosstodon that
        focuses on Free and Open Source Software, I believe we are
        living in an incredible time where the tools we need for a
        federated, decentralized, ad-free, people-centric world are
        being created...all without even jumping on the
        crypto-currency bandwagon :-).  There are extant/emerging
        solutions for authoring, messaging, social networking,
        distributed source code control and many more.  Herein lies
        another long post, but to me this "feels" very like the early
        days of GNU and Linux.

***** Steve Francia - Hugo
      One last entry in the things-I-have-used-to-write lineup.  The
      Hugo static web site generator is bringing you this blog.

      The production of this blog combines many of the technologies
      and processes already discussed:

      - org mode :: The actual source for this blog is a "normal"
        emacs org mode buffer which is exported via the ox-hugo
        backend

      - $\LaTeX$ :: The ox-hugo exporter deals seamlessly
        with almost all org features, including $\LaTeX$[fn:15],
        footnotes, /emphasis/, etc.

      - Web :: Once the markdown is produced, Hugo does what it does.
        It uses style sheets, templates, themes etc to render the blog
        as HTML served up via a local web server for texting and to be
        pushed to the "live" web serer for production.

      - Focus on the content :: And all of this is in the "don't worry
        what it looks like, just focus on the content" mode.  With 4
        keystrokes I exported a copy of this post to =.ODT= format so
        my son could review it in word.  A different 4 keystokes
        exports to text or HTML.  I let the back-ends "do the right
        thing" to make it "look good" in the target format.

      - git :: Once the results are satisfactory, they are "pushed to
        production" via =git push=.  Problems?  Need to back out?
        It's git.   Multiple authors?  It's git.

      I described this process in way too much detail already
      elsewhere in my blog post on [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/hugo-org-github/][publishing a blog on Github with
      Org and Hugo]].

***** George Jones - OK, but did George actually write anything worth reading?

      You've read this far on a long blog post :-)

      I may have written some things, well, a lot of things.  You can
      decide if they are worth reading.

      - [[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3871][https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3871]] :: RFC3871 was a
        starry-eyed attempt at getting large network equipment vendors
        to, you know, stop using telnet (with plain-text passwords in
        the clear) for management of inconsequential computers like
        the routers that make up the Internet backbone.  It used yet
        another cool text formatting tool, [[https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/][xml2rfc]].  In my opinion we
        lost the war, e.g. getting security features in important
        devices ... and well ... IOT devices are here now, many using
        the same least-cost TCP/IP stacks that are full of the same
        problems, see
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ripple20
        and not
        up-gradable.  It looks like the [[https://tools.ietf.org/wg/opsec/charters][IETF OPSEC Working Group]] that
        that document spawned is still going, pumping out documents,
        and, I'm sure, in the words of Marshall Rose, there have been

***** Back to paper

      I used to have a saying:

      #+begin_quote
      If it requires paper, it's the wrong interface.
      #+end_quote

      I'm backtracking on that.  I journal, on paper, most mornings.
      I'm finding that there is a level of creativity, spontaneity and
      a kind of catharsis that happens when putting things on paper.
      I make non-linear connections that would never be made at a
      keyboard.

      I'm not sure what that's saying.  Stay open?  Be willing to
      re-consider things you've discarded?   There will be no follows.
      No likes.  No re-shares.  No chance of going viral.  But its
      where I find my thoughts.  Things have come full circle.

***** Final thoughts
      I hope this has been at least an in interesting read.  I hope it
      has provided at least some idea of where we are and how we got
      here in terms of technology for putting thoughts on "paper".

[fn:10] Knuth's /The Art Of Computer Programming/ is available on
github.  I'm not going to provide a link because when I went there and
tried to view the site it crashed my browser and nearly froze my
computer.  My guess is Knuth just did something that was perfectly
sensible from a theoretical view (maybe creating a 50 gig PDF), but
which mere software chokes on.  Computer Science classic texts as DOS
attacks?  Another unintended side effect.  I wonder if [[https://attack.mitre.org/][MITRE ATT&CK]]

***** Knuth gets annoyed at his publishers, $\TeX$ is born.
Back in the late 70s Donald Knuth who was (and still is) publishing a
seminal series of Computer Science text books got annoyed at the
typesetting, layouts and font choices he was being presented by
publishers.   So he did what any self-respecting hacker who happened
to be Donald Knuth would do: he created his own typesetting system
called $\TeX$ which (along with $\LaTeX$ which borrowed heavily from SCRIBE)
is something of a standard to this day in academic publishing.

Because, you know, why is it unreasonable to expect publishers to
render simple equations, right?

\begin{multline*}
\vec{E}_{\mathrm{tot}}=
  q\cdot k_{b}\cdot \dfrac{r}{r^3}

***** Literate Programming
In addition to writing his own typesetting system, he came up with the
concept of /Literate Programming/ at the same time.   The basic idea
is that you write for humans to read (e.g. text books) with a
side-effect of outputting code (for machines to execute).   It is the
ultimate in software documentation.   The code and the description are
an integrated whole with different processes, "tangle", to produce code
and "weave"[fn:8], to produce output for humans


I've been influenced by the concept of /Literate Programming/ ever
since I installed the original TeX (and LaTex) on CompuServe's DEC10s.

***** The children of tangle and weave - Org, Babel, Jupyter and Zepplin

Fast forward a few decades.  Carsten Dominick creates org mode for
Emacs to organize, well, everything which, of course, has a back end
to output .tex files.   Eric Schulte then has the bright ideas of
creating org-babel, which allows small (or not so small) blocks of
code to be imbedded in org files and executed with their output
becoming part of the document.   Literate programming, here were are,
again....oh, and it's a tool for doing reproducible scientific
research as well where the data, code, descriptions of experiments and
results/conclusions are all one document:

https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v046i03

Jupyter and Zeppelin notebooks provide similar functionality today for
Python, Spark, Scala and the data science community, but Knuth was
there 40 years ago.

***** George gets annoyed at a complicated .bashrc, .bashrc.org is born

Which brings me to my own humble annoyances which are not likely to
change the course of science or academic publishing...

As a nearly lifelong emacs user I am mildly annoyed any time I have to do
something that can't be done in emacs in general, and have been
particularly annoyed at the growing complexity of my =.bashrc= file
which could not be organize and documented in org mode....until now.

***** EmacsConf 2020 talk: README Driven Design
      A talk at EmacsConf 2020 reminded me that Org mode can be used
      directly for literate programming.

      Test Driven Design (TDD) had been a concept for a while: write
      your tests first, once your code passes, you're done.  Find a
      bug, write a new test, code until it passes.

      "README Driven Design" continues in the same vein.  Often
      programmers will wait to the end to write their documentation,
      install notes, user guide etc.  What this talk advocates is to
      use literate programming and to /start/ the README.org, which,
      given Org babel, could be the whole application, including TDD
      scripts.  See. Emacs does subsume all, did you notice how TDD
      just got swallowed up without missing a step?  See the blog post
      summarizing the talk at
      [[http://adamard.com/literate_programming.html][http://adamard.com/literate_programming.html]]

*****  1 - My .bashrc as literate programming

      What follows are three different versions of my (457 line)
      =.bashrc= file.

      The first is the version for-human-consumption, complete with
      comments, descriptions, useful font highlighting and actual text
      blocked out. In Knuth's terms, this is the "weave" output.

      The second is the .bashrc that actually gets executed by bash.
      This is the "tangle" output.

      The last is the org mode source from which both preceding
      versions used as input.

****** 1.1 - My .bashrc - weave output for humans

       Here is the human-readable .bashrc file with comments, etc.

******* About this .bashrc file
******** Intro
         This is George Jones' .bashrc file as an literate programming file in
         emacs org mode using babel blocks.

******** To generate the actual .bashrc
         This .bashrc.org file must be processed to generate the actual
         .bashrc It can be processed interactively to generate .bashrc via
         org-babel-tangle-file or from the command line as

         #+begin_example
  emacs --batch --eval "(require 'org)" --eval '(org-babel-tangle-file ".bashrc.org")'
         #+end_example

         Permanent changes must be made to the .org version, as the actual
         .bashrc will be overwritten when the .org version is "compiled"

******** Debugging

        In most bash files I do

        #+begin_example
  set -e
  set -u
        #+end_example

        but there are problems setting it in .bashrc.   An error then causes
        you to exit the shell entirely (not what you want), and there are
        several constructs that cause warnings due to undefined variables
        (these can/probably should be fixd)

        Set

        #+begin_example
  export DEBUG=1
        #+end_example

        to enable debugging output from the debug helper function.

******* The actual executable .bashrc
******** Helper functions
         I define a few syslog-ish helper functions to print warnings,
         errors, etc.

         #+begin_src shell :tangle .bashrc :noweb no-export
  #PROG=`basename "$0" | tr -d '\n'`  # normal setting
  PROG="bashrc" # setting for bashrc due to errors

  function info()  { echo ${PROG}\: info: "$@" 1>&2; }
  function warn()  { echo ${PROG}\: warning: "$@" 1>&2; }
  function error() { echo ${PROG}\: error: "$@" 1>&2; }
  function debug() { [[ -v DEBUG ]] && echo ${PROG}\: debug: "$@" 1>&2 || true ; }
  function die()   { echo ${PROG}\: fatal: "$@" 1>&2 && exit 1; }
         #+end_src

******** Set a reasonable default prompt

         Here I set a reasonable default prompt that includes timestamp,
         username, host and current directory:

       #+begin_src shell :tangle .bashrc :noweb no-export
export PS1="\# [\t] \u@\h \W/ $ "
       #+end_src

******** Misc aliases

         Define various aliases that I use

         #+begin_src shell :tangle .bashrc :noweb no-export
  alias rm='	rm -i'
  alias ag='	alias | grep -i'
  alias eg='	printenv | grep -i'
  alias hg='	history | grep -i'
  alias ht='	history | tail'
  alias fpg='	find . -print | egrep -i'
  alias egi='	egrep -i'
  alias psg='	/bin/ps -auxww | grep'
  alias p8='	ping -c 3 8.8.8.8' # make sure routing works
  alias pp='	ping -c 3 port111.com' # make sure dns and routing work
  alias locate='locate -r'
         #+end_src

******** cd commands that use/print the directory stack

         These aliases support pushd/popd/dirs like functionality while
         listing one directory per line

         I like to keep a "stack" of directories so I can work on one thing
         then "pop" back to where I was.   =pushd= an =popd= support this,
         and =dirs= lists the directories, but I prefer to have them listed
         one per line.


         #+begin_src shell :tangle .bashrc :noweb no-export
  function dirl() {
      # "DIR"ectory "L"ist directory stack, one per line
      # Usage: dirl

      for d in `dirs`; do echo $d; done
  }

  function dirc() {
      # "DIR"ectory "C"onnect - connect to directory and list stack
      # Usage: dirc [DIR

      pushd ${1:-"$HOME"} > /dev/null
      dirl
  }

  function dirp () {
      # "DIR"ectory "P"op - pop N entries off the directory stack
      # Usage: dirp [N]
      #
      # OLD:
      #   alias  dirp='popd > /dev/null && dirl'

****** 1.3 - My .bashrc - The org mode source file


Here is the .bash.org input file

,#+language: en
,#+select_tags: export
,#+exclude_tags: noexport
,#+creator: Emacs 28.0.50 (Org mode 9.4)


,* About this .bashrc file
,** Intro
   This is George Jones' .bashrc file as an literate programming file in
   emacs org mode using babel blocks.

,** To generate the actual .bashrc
   This .bashrc.org file must be processed to generate the actual
   .bashrc It can be processed interactively to generate .bashrc via
   org-babel-tangle-file or from the command line as

   ,#+begin_example
  emacs --batch --eval "(require 'org)" --eval '(org-babel-tangle-file ".bashrc.org")'
   ,#+end_example

   Permanent changes must be made to the .org version, as the actual
   .bashrc will be overwritten when the .org version is "compiled"

,** Debugging

  In most bash files I do

  ,#+begin_example
  set -e
  set -u
  ,#+end_example

  but there are problems setting it in .bashrc.   An error then causes
  you to exit the shell entirely (not what you want), and there are
  several constructs that cause warnings due to undefined variables
  (these can/probably should be fixd)

  Set

  ,#+begin_example
  export DEBUG=1
  ,#+end_example

  to enable debugging output from the debug helper function.

,* The actual executable .bashrc
,** Helper functions
   I define a few syslog-ish helper functions to print warnings,
   errors, etc.

   ,#+begin_src shell :tangle .bashrc :noweb no-export
  #PROG=`basename "$0" | tr -d '\n'`  # normal setting
  PROG="bashrc" # setting for bashrc due to errors

  function info()  { echo ${PROG}\: info: "$@" 1>&2; }
  function warn()  { echo ${PROG}\: warning: "$@" 1>&2; }
  function error() { echo ${PROG}\: error: "$@" 1>&2; }
  function debug() { [[ -v DEBUG ]] && echo ${PROG}\: debug: "$@" 1>&2 || true ; }
  function die()   { echo ${PROG}\: fatal: "$@" 1>&2 && exit 1; }
   ,#+end_src

,** Set a reasonable default prompt

   Here I set a reasonable default prompt that includes timestamp,
   username, host and current directory:

 ,#+begin_src shell :tangle .bashrc :noweb no-export
export PS1="\# [\t] \u@\h \W/ $ "
 ,#+end_src

,** Misc aliases

   Define various aliases that I use

   ,#+begin_src shell :tangle .bashrc :noweb no-export
  alias rm='	rm -i'
  alias ag='	alias | grep -i'
  alias eg='	printenv | grep -i'
  alias hg='	history | grep -i'
  alias ht='	history | tail'
  alias fpg='	find . -print | egrep -i'
  alias egi='	egrep -i'
  alias psg='	/bin/ps -auxww | grep'
  alias p8='	ping -c 3 8.8.8.8' # make sure routing works
  alias pp='	ping -c 3 port111.com' # make sure dns and routing work
  alias locate='locate -r'
   ,#+end_src

,** cd commands that use/print the directory stack

   These aliases support pushd/popd/dirs like functionality while
   listing one directory per line

   I like to keep a "stack" of directories so I can work on one thing
   then "pop" back to where I was.   =pushd= an =popd= support this,
   and =dirs= lists the directories, but I prefer to have them listed
   one per line.

# Tim, Jono, Leigh

In my never ending quest for synthesis, this post combines thoughts on
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop][the OODA loop]] and falling out of a canoe twice this weekend in rapids
on the Shenandoah river.  There is a connection.  Maybe.

If you want to see the full trip report, pictures, etc. go here [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/get-wet/][Things
that fall in the river get wet]].  If you're interested in how this relates to
the OODA loop or, better, if you have experience/thoughts on applying
the OODA loop to operational cybersecurity settings, read on (and
comment !)

***** The OODA Loop

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop][The OODA loop]] is a concept cybersecurity has borrowed from the US Air Force.
"OODA" stands for "Observe, Orient, Decide, Act".
The OODA loop began as a very fighter-pilot-centric view of a problem
space.  I always think of Snoopy and the Red Barron.  Snoopy
*observes* the Red Barron at a distance, *orients* his Sopwith-Camel
towards the Red Barron, *decides* to fire, and then *acts* by firing-away.
Then repeat the OODA loop.  *Observe*: what was the effect of your
action (the Red Barron went down in flames, or you missed and now he's on your
tail)...

***** The OODA Loop and falling out of a canoe
The OODA loop parallels my decision making process in the rapids this
weekend.  In one of our two crisis events I *observed* the other
canoe flip in the rapids ahead.  I *oriented* my canoe towards shore.
I *decided* to grab a tree root to buy time to sit and contemplate
options.  I *acted* by grabbing the tree root.  We flipped due to the
strong current.
REPEAT.
I *observed* that we were in the water 10 or 20 yards (9 to 18 meters)
from the start
of the rapids.  I *oriented* myself towards shore.  I *decided* to
swim to shore at all costs (loosing the canoe and all our gear) rather
than float the rapids in life jackets.  I *acted* by swimming to shore.
REPEAT.
I *observed* that we were safe on shore without our boat, gear or
friends.  I *oriented* myself downstream.  I *decided* to walk in
search of boat, gear and friends.  I *acted* by walking...

***** Where does the OODA loop work well?

The OODA loop seems to be a good model for rapidly changing situations
where the personal stakes to the actor are high, the actor is
receiving relevant information in a timely fashion and has the ability
to decide on appropriate action and execute in a very short
timescale.  There were elements of this in Bill Cheswick's classic [[https://www.cheswick.com/ches/papers/berferd.pdf][An
Evening with Berferd]] and Cliff Stoll's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg][The Cuckoo's Egg]], but I am
wondering how many of these conditions apply, to, say the modern SOC?


***** Does the OODA loop work in SOCs?

How do the characteristics of crisis situations such has that
described above or a fighter pilot in dogfight map to the modern SOC?
Does a SOC have a rapidly changing situation?  Probably.  Are there
personal stakes for the actor (analyst)?  It depends.  Is it just
"work my shift and go home after the hand-off"?  Are the actors
(analysts) receiving relevant information in a timely fashion?  Or are
they waiting for a weeks-long (months-long?) approval process for the
ingest of needed data, the provisioning of enough storage and compute
power to run the queries they need?  Are they empowered to take action
in a short timescale?  Or are there three levels of management
approval needed and reports to be written before any action can taken?
Can they take machines offline, implement blocks, etc?  Even if it
impacts production?  Can they observe, orient, decide and act, or is
it time to put your feet up, hope for the best and float through the
rapids?

Your thoughts?  Experiences?

**** PUBLISHED Bear attacks, no-win situations and cybersecurity      :bears:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: cybersecurity-and-bears
:EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE: 2020-03-19:
:END:

I spend a good amount of time hiking in Shenandoah National Park and
surrounding areas. I've seen quite a few #bears and I've followed one
down the trail. I've been growled at by a mother bear when I
unknowingly came between her and her cubs. This is going somewhere
related to #cybersecurity. I promise.

You can't outrun a bear. Climbing a tree won't help. If a bear
actually decides to attack you, the odds are not in your favor, but
fortunately they almost never attack. The old joke goes "I don't have
to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun you" because, presumably the
bear will catch your slower partner, stop, and not bother you when you
both decide to run for it in violation of bear encounter best
practices.

This hints at any number of cybersecurity principals:

- Know your threat model.
- Know and follow best practices.
- Don't let fear (or adrenaline) dictate your response.
- Know and practice situationally appropriate responses (Grizzlies:
  if attacked play dead. Black Bear: if attacked fight for your
  life)
- Be prepared (bear spray, first aid kit)
- Practice deterrence (make noise, travel in groups)
- Prevention costs less than recovery. By far.
- And, of course, make sure the other guy is an easier target. Run faster if you run. Apply patches, have good backups (Hello, ransomware !), have layers of defense, decoys, monitoring, DLP, practice threat hunting, etc.
   For a decade or so, I've been reflecting on the fact that
  defensive cybersecurity is a loosing igame. The red team
  (attackers) always win. I don't like no-win situations.

There's a lesson here:

- Don't feed the bears :: They become habituated to humans, loose
     their inhibition, become a nuisance and sometimes have to be
     relocated or killed. Nobody wins.

OK, not that lesson. Lessons like:

- Follow best practices :: Following best practices CAN help avoid
     problems. Not following best practices WILL invite problems.
- Have an incident response plan :: If you see a bad thing
     happening, if it is coming straight for you, what do you do?
- Line up the right resources :: Do you know how to triage
     wounds? Do you have a cell phone? Are you in range of cell
     towers? If not, do you have a SPOT to call for help? Where is
     the nearest hospital? Are you prepared to shelter in place if
     need be?
- It's not just you :: Feeding the bears or failing to store food
     properly might result in perfectly good backcountry shelters
     being torn down. And here we are, 20 or so years after it
     became clear that that allowing spoofed packets out of your
     network enables #DDoS #attacks and we *still* do not have
     widespread adoption of reverse path forwarding
     checks. *Please* stop spoofed packets at your border !


So it maybe true that few people win in the face of an actual attack,
but, it turns out, there are still good reasons to play the game.

***** Questions to ask

When identifying Internet-based assets, there are a series of basic
questions[fn:6] that need to answered:

- What is it?
- How do I know?
- How certain am I?
- Is it "bad"?
  - depends on who you are
  - depends on time
- What can I do about it?


***** An Example: Web servers serving pages with flash
One example can be used to illustrate the point: web servers
serving content with Adobe Flash
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash).

Flash is an older web technology that has known security
vulnerabilities, is deprecated (Adobe to stop supporting it on
12/31/2020) and has been replace by HTML5.

Let's classify it using the questions above, assuming we have
scanned a web site and pulled back the HTML body of the main page
via an HTTP GET request:

- What is it? :: A web server serving pages with flash.

- How do I know? :: We see files with =.swf= extensions embedded in
     javascript returned as part of the web page, e.g.
#+begin_example
    var swfpath="/e/data/images/pixviewer.swf
#+end_example


- How certain am I? :: Your signatures may vary.  There are other
     strings you can look for such as:

#+begin_example
application/x-shockwave-flash
#+end_example

#+begin_example
http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer
#+end_example

You might start with a google search for

#+begin_example
intext:http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer
#+end_example

It's just a question of how much time you want to put into
developing the signature.  For some things (HTML) there is a lot
of ambiguity. For others (TCP, HTTP, SNMP, SSH...) the protocol
will not work if the transactions are not well defined.
Identification of less well defined protocols is ad hoc based on
heuristics.  Identification of well defined protocols is more
certain. See below.

- Is it "bad"? It depends. :: Once we've answered the "what is it"
     question, you can begin to address the "is it bad" question and
     possibly it's corollary "how bad is it?" (not addressed here).
     Lets return to our flash example.  It turns out Chinese web sites
     are a large current (2020-09-17) source of flash on the web.  A
     security products vendor also uses a lot of flash on their login
     page.

  - *'Is it bad?' depends on who you are*

    1. Chinese government? Maybe you WANT people to download
       vulnerable software to enhance your ability to monitor
       citizens activity.
    2. Chinese human rights activist? You probably don't want known
       vulnerable software on your computer.
    3. Security vendor?  Forcing your security minded customers to
       download and run known vulnerable software as part of logging
       into your security web site is, at best, bad form.

  - *'Is it bad?' "Is it bad" "depends on time*
    When did vulnerabilities in the product become widely known (e.g. a CVE
    published)?  When was "proof of concept" exploit code available?
    When are/were patches/upgrades available? ...

  - *'Is it bad?' depends on where you are*
    Are you at work on a laptop supplied by your employer who has a policy against
    accessing web sites that use flash?  Are you at home or in a lab
    doing web vulnerability research on a "throwaway" machine...

- What can I do about it? :: Lastly, and probably most importantly,
     the question is "What can I do about it?".  Are there steps I
     can/should take to fix things that are "bad"?  Patch? Upgrade?
     Choose a different security vendor...?

***** Keep each issue separate, think about them independently

It is important to keep the answers to these questions separate.
For instance saying "write some software to find bad things on web
servers" presupposes a common definition of "bad", which, as we've
seen above can be highly contextual.

It would be far better to keep them separate.   For instance, define
a taxonomy (see below) to say "what is this"?   Then separately
devise ways to answer the "is it bad" question for separate
environments (countries, organizations, individuals ...)

***** Taxonomies, Ontologies and ASCII Art, Oh My !!!

The outline above lists the basic questions.  It is possible that
there will be a need for a deeper dive/more complete classification.
For instance, revisiting *what is it?* for the web server with
flash, we might come up with this taxonomy:


#+begin_example
  + open port                      WELL DEFINED, CERTAIN IDENTIFICATION
    + tcp
      + tls                                        ^
        + web server                               |
           + microsoft                             |
             + iis                                 |
               + 7.3                               |
                 + services                        |
                   + flash                         v
                 + frameworks
                    + dotnet       LESS DEFINED, LESS CERTAIN IDENTIFICATION
#+end_example

Taxonomies help in classifying, understanding and communicating
about things, for instance taxonomies (and Latin names) have been
used in Biology for hundreds of years.  More recently, the
cybersecurity world started standardizing vulnerability naming as
CVE.

***** Conclusion

When thinking about Internet assets, writing software to detect and
classify/fingerprint assets and deciding what to call "bad", keep
the preceding questions in mind and try to keep the questions
separate.

In this world where Big Internet firms track you to sell you stuff
(and to sell YOU), big Government tracks you because, well, they can,
and where I found myself on a motion activated camera when backpacking
alone in the "backcountry" in an attempt to "get away from it all",
I've spend some time thinking about privacy.

Life is short.  I could spend a lot of time registering domain names,
managing certificates, running my own mail server, de-googling,
convincing my friends and family to use nifty new security and privacy
apps, and generally fighting the privacy fight as an individual
against entire well-funded industries and governments.  Or I could
just live my life secure in the knowledge that Google and Amazon know
what I'm thinking of purchasing even before I do.

I recently went backpacking on the Appalachian Trail in Massachusetts.
One of the reasons I go out is to "get away", to go "off the grid", to
enjoy nature and get away from adds, trackers, social media, etc.

But a funny thing happened at my last campsite.  There was a camera
strapped to a tree taking my picture every time I put my food in or
out of the "bear box".  The sign on the camera, in addition to asking
us not disturb the camera (duct tape, anyone ?) assured us that they
were only using the images to track bear activity at the campsite and
the images would be destroyed after being used for their intended
purpose.  Right.  They would not be fed to facial recognition
software, and the results would not be passed to law enforcement.
Right.

In addition to that, many hikers now use the "[[https://atlasguides.com/?cn-reloaded=1][Guthook]]" app to track
their progress, find distance to water, etc.  It has social media-like
features that let you leave messages to help other hikers like "there
is a good stealth campsite at this stream...".  And such comments
suggesting helpful, but sometimes over the official line actions,
which are absolutely not being monitored by park officials (looking at
you Smokies, Baxter) and others concerned with keeping everyone
strictly in line with the mountains of rules made by people sitting at
desks who have NOT just hiked 8 to 12 hours a day for days on end and
have no appreciation of or sympathy for realities in the field.

Mind you, I'm all for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave_No_Trace][Leave No Trace]], minimizing impact, ensuring that
others have the same opportunities I crave to enjoy nature, not
killing cute little animals out of sheer cruelty, etc, but...

***** What's bothering me

      It takes a lot of work to change your email provider of 15
      years.  You loose contacts when you ditch Facebook (that guy
      I've not seen since 3rd grade..).  Twitter is, well, a thing.
      Just ask the President ('nuf said ?)  So why go the trouble?
      What is it about privacy that gets me and so many people spun up
      to the point that we will spend time fighting what is almost
      certainly a loosing battle against Big Brother, Big Internet and
      Big Advertising?

      There are many reasons, but I think they all center around what
      it means to be human:

      - We want to be left alone sometimes
      - We want space to be ourselves
      - We want our thoughts to be our thoughts (and we want to have
        them before the machine learning algorithms that are tracking
        us have them)
      - We want the freedom to think, act, feel, love and hate ("[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus_85][Odi
        et amo]] ...") as we see fit, at least inside our own heads
      - We want to be able to work out life for ourselves
      - We want space to think, to grow, to make mistakes and correct
        them, or even to be free to persist in our chosen errors and
        delusions. "To err is human..."

      Something about using the current set of "free" Big Internet
      offerings where, "If you're not paying for it you ARE the
      product" violates the space we so desperately need.

***** Back to the big thinkers

      Enough of my ramblings.  Back to the deep thinkers who put
      together the encyclopedic /A History of Private Life/ in 1987
      without (gasp) Google or anything better than a IBM-PC running
      DOS...

#+begin_quote
...at all times and in all places a clear commonsensical distinction
has been made the public --- that which is open to the community and
subject to the authority of its magistrates --- and the private.  In
other words, a clearly defined realm is set aside for that part of
existence for which /every language has a word equivalent to
"private"/, a zone of immunity to which we may fall back or retreat, a
place where we may set aside arms and armor needed in the public
place, relax, take our ease, and lie about unshielded...this is the
place where the family thrives, the realm of domesticity; it is also
the realm of secrecy.   The private realm contains our most precious
possessions, which belong only to ourselves, which concern nobody
else, and which may not be divulged...

Georges Duby, Forward to /A History of Private Life/, 1987
#+end_quote

Is he right?  Do /you/ have the space you need to "protect the essence
of individuality from headlong technological progress"?

"I'm passionate about..." I've always hated that phrase. Because I
thought it was fake. I thought it was trendy. I've reflexively reacted
against trendy things for decades. Pet Rocks, Disco, TED talks,
cryptocurrency... But I am coming to see what the phrase is getting
at. And I think I like it.

In a work world where human beings are called "resources", where
intelligent, creative, inquisitive, motivated people are subjected to
management practices derived from 19th century steel mills and
automotive assembly line production, the phrase "I'm passionate
about..." is (can be) an attempt to re-assert humanity.

I've just finished reading [[https://www.amazon.com/Long-Live-Latin-Pleasures-Language/dp/0374284520#ace-8881249860][Long Live Latin: The Pleasures of a Useless
Language]] . For no good reason. Again and again, it raises the question
of what it means to be human: to be joyful, spontaneous, creative,
inquisitive, fulfilled, to discover, to appreciate beauty, music, art,
language, and poetry (yes, I have a liberal arts degree)

I guess if I had to say what I'm passionate about, it's about being
human and treating other people as humans. To put a professional spin
on it "I am passionate about collaborating with technical people to
find creative solutions to important problems."

Go learn a useless language. Climb a mountain and enjoy the
view. Spend time playing games with your family. Be human. Be
passionate. Carpe diem.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wilhite][Steve Wilhite]] is the most prolific programmer I've ever known.  He's
mostly remembered for creating [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gif][GIF]] but he spent 30 years writing piles
of amazing software which helped set the stage for the Web.

Day 02 of #100DaysToOffload.

#+hugo: more

Steve worked at CompuServe (and successors) from 1970 to 2001.  I
was fortunate enough to start my career working with/for him.  My
view of his programming output comes largely from 1985-1995.  I'm
sure there was much more that I missed.

***** Things Steve Wrote
Steve ran the languages and tools group when I arrived.  /He had just/
/given up on writing at DEC10 ADA compiler/[fn:2] (Steve is still writing
ADA software), was just beginning to embrace PCs as "real computers"
worthy of his attention, had written a FORTRAN compiler, a BASIC
compiler and associated run-time systems, and a run-time library for
BLISS called BTOOLS.  These were partially in support of
CompuServe's pre-information-service time-sharing services supported
by a homegrown packet-switched networking.  "Cloud computing" in the
1970s :-)

I worked on BTOOLS, SKIMAN (Single Key Index Access Manager), a
B-Tree library Steve had created.  There was a full-fledged database
system written in there somewhere I think.  There were ports and
hacks to various tools such as FINE (Fine Is Not Emacs), a C
compiler, DEC Runoff, laser printer support, source code control
systems, etc.

On top of that, Steve created the HMI (Host Micro Interface)
protocol that rode on top of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b_protocol][CompuServe "B-Protocol"]] to allow API
driven interactions with the information service (the alternative
being text/command line interfaces).  This was all in an environment
where 9600baud modems were considered "fast".  Compression,
incremental display, etc. were paramount.

He later used that as the substrate for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compuserve_information_manager][WinCim]], the graphical interface
to the information service that he created which kept the company
going for a while in the face of the likes of AOL.  Somewhere in
there, there was a graphics library and enough pieces that I was
able to write a web browser that worked inside WinCim, that would
have allowed CompuServe users without an Internet connection (most
everyone then) to browse the web.  Marketing did not want to release
my web browser.  *Sigh*.

Later on (after my time) Steve as pulled into major projects to support
the back end processing for H&R Blocks's TaxCut program when online
tax-filing was a new thing.  /He was also pulled into the WOW project/
/which was supposed to be the AOL killer when it became apparent that/
/CompuServe needed an AOL killer./[fn:3]  One of those projects succeeded.
Single-handed technical virtuosity could not fix the one that
didn't.

And there was this little side project called GIF.

***** Things that got out

****** GIF
Be careful what you do and say.  It's often the incidentals that you
are remembered for.  The kind (or unkind) words.  The side projects.

In the world of the mid 80s there were IBM PCs, Apple Macs
(classic), Amigas, Atari-STs, CoCos, and yes, Apple-IIs and
Commodor-68s.  The information service was moving beyond a
text-based, menu-driven system (I like curses and termcap as much as
the next guy, but hey..).  People wanted to share pictures, display
online-shopping catalogs, weather maps, etc.  There were no/few good
portable graphics formats.  So Steve wrote one.  GIF.  Then the web happened.
The web wanted portable images too.  GIF worked.  So the early web
adopted it.  There was the kerfuffle over the LZW compression
algorithm it used resulting in the creation of the PNG format, but,
hey, who in 1987 would ever think that an algorithm published in ACM
might not be free.  OK, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_stallman][Stallman]], but who else :-).  And now there
are Giffy's in slack that I turn off because I hate dancing bears.
Thank-you Steve.

***** MicroEmacs/mg display hacks

And then there are the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MicroEmacs][MiroEmacs]] display hacks.  When the Amiga came
out Steve convinced me to buy one (it was that or the AtariST, he
had and was hacking on both).  But there was no Emacs.  Somehow
(Steve?) I became aware that the source to MicroEmacs was included
on with the disks to Mark Williams C compiler for the PC.  So I bought
the C compiler, ported the source to the Amiga (all it needed was
character I/O drivers to work in the native ANSI/VT-100 terminal)
and gave the source to Steve, who, I think, hacked/improved the
screen update logic.  I then posted the source to the USENET group
comp.sources.amiga. It took off from there (thanks to Daniel
Lawerence).  It's rumored that Linus Torvalds uses a version of the
code to this day.


***** CompuServe: Groundbreaking events, great teams and amazing individuals.

At the recent (2019-10-19) CompuServe 50th Anniversary reunion I
was reminded of the revolutionary things that happened there: the
first commercial email, the first online banking, the first
online shopping, the first electronic news wire feed, the first
song released exclusively online (Arrowsmith 1994), online chat
(CB), OS and compiler development, VPNs (X.25 !), data over cable
in 82....and Dan Piskur inventing what we know today as much of
standard online security, incident response and "cyber"/law
enforcement collaboration, all before the Internet.

Of course it all took the efforts of many people and groups:  the
network software team (packet switching c.a. 1972, take that
DARPA), the "monitor group" (TOPS-10 OS development),
MicroComputer Software (terminal emulators forever !), large
systems software (billing et. al.), and of course the genius of
the founders (John Goltz) and the vision of Jeff Wilkins (CEO
1970-1985).

There's a lot to be said for being in the right place at the
right time, and for having a team, but many things do not happen
without the essential contributions of amazing individuals.

Thanks Steve.

***** Footnotes

[fn:2] Steve corrected me.  There were never actually plans to write
an Ada compiler.  But I was unaware of the XBASIC compiler.   So 3
compilers in all.

[fn:3] Steve informs me he was NOT pulled into the WOW project.  Maybe
the outcome would have been better if he had...


[fn:1] yes, there are many better tools for this job, but not in the constrained environment where this had to run.

So, when life turns uncertain you have two choices.   Cling to
things that seem to add stability and certainty, i.e. try to "stay
safe", or embrace the uncertainty, live now, carpe diem, and do
things would seem to be fulfilling now.

I'm choosing the latter.  At 58, in the middle of a pandemic and
social unrest, I'm moving to a startup. The following are notes
from a friend who has been playing the silicon valley startup game
for a few decades.   These are notes-to-self and anybody else who
cares from that conversation:

- Map out the architecture of the org/org structure (official)
  vs. what is actually working
- Whats the (people) API: theory, practice?
- Find "they guy who built it, knows everything"
- What is the aspirational architecture vs. what's really built?
- Find "the guy" who has it all in his head, maybe stuff that has
  not made it to paper.   Whiteboard it, write it up.
- Most places don't do that
- Look at reality vs. getting stuck in "my teams perspective"
- Use systems thinking to figure it all out
- Find the "old salts" who know where the bodies are buried, not
  "official channels"
- "First 90 Days", book
- "An elegant puzzle", book
- #1 lesson for all startups: "IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH CASH YOU
  HAVE IN THE BANK"
- If company is healthy, CFO knows burn rate, want's whole company
  to be thinking about it
- Health check: how aware are people of cash position?
- Build vs. buy
- Bailing wire and duct tape?
- WATCH BURN RATE, WATCH REVENUE
- Valuable people: people who understand tech and that you have to
  be a functioning business,  i.e. you need more $ revenue than
  you are spending
- People should be excited about growth
- Watch out for scaling company before projected/actual growth in revenue
- Biz/finance folks should be excited about you being interested
  in finances.  Defensiveness is a warning sign.   You WANT people
  who care about $.  People share what they are interested in
- Working remote, COVID
  - open door policy?
  - Ask admin assistant "Can I get 1/2 hour on X's calendar"?
  - Have/ask leading questions
  - Dig into current, next challenges
  - Demonstrate that you are thoughtful and someone who wants to
    make things work
- Most important: GET THINGS DONE
- reward/appreciated if you are seen as someone who wants to make
  things work, shape product
- not "staying in my lane"
- culture to pass things on, figure out where the holes are, fill them
- Each team should have onboarding guide
- Whoever was last onboarded updates it
- if not, as ?Mentor? to get it
- You should have a mentor
- there should be a doc that includes "what IT didn't tell you
- "When I build systems, I try to build something with good
  [benefits?] but light filling" (e.g. don't over-engineer)
- Two bad extremes:
  - Try to build something that works now, don't "boil the ocean"
  - Pure agile people...constant refinement, incrementalism.
- e.g. you know you need a memory managers.  Start with an

- People.  There are always "a few of 'those' people", hard to

***** Bryan's Music

The corona virus has wreaked havoc with many things, not the least
of which is the performing arts, but, as they say, "the show must
go on".  The program was to have been a live performance, but
things being what they are (social distancing) recordings where
made to satisfy the requirement.

The program includes:

- Schumann: Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13 (original version, 1837)
- Debussy: Images Book II - I. Cloches à travers les feuilles
- Debussy: Images Book II - II. Et la lune descend sur le temple qui fut
- Debussy: Images Book II - III. Poissons d'or
- Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - I. Allegro marcato
- Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - II. Presto misterioso
- Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - III. Adagio molto appassionato
- Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - IV. Ruvido ed ostinato

I particularly like the Debussy.

***** Other Happy Notes

My other son Daniel is finishing out his junior year at Cedarville
from home.  Bryan's girlfriend (also graduating from Duquesne) will
again spend the summer doing something she loves, counting birds for
Bird Conservancy of the Rockies.  A "kid" I knew from scouting is
headed off for a masters in biomedical engineering this fall, and we
may hike together a week or two if possible in June or July.

least that's how it goes in Virginia)

I was on email as early as 1980 on a DEC20. I was on Usenet news
when it was the digital frontier and on the Internet in the
mid-80s, 10 years or so before the Web.  I helped bring America
online working at CompuServe before America Online existed.  I
quit Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 election as it got too
political and now I find that my main digital platform (Twitter)
is home to the daily, um, ?sophisms? of the President who spawned
the political rhetoric I fled.

Is it time to move on?  Time to find another avant-guard tech hole
to clime into?  Thanks to the Internet there are infinitely more
options than just the dial-up BBS systems of the early 80s.

I was a little sad to loose contact with all the elementary school
friends that Facebook enabled me to reconnect with after 40 years
(OK, not really) and I would be sad too loose touch with the zany

Getting started in life is harder right now.  I have two college age
sons who both just finished up their year with online classes, and
both are home now. In "normal" times they would be working summer jobs or participating
in other activities that would help them advance toward their chosen
careers.  Jobs may or may not happen.  Even getting out of the house
may not happen much.  These are weird times.

I am happy to help my sons with a place to live, emotional and other

increased independence.  The opportunities to do that are drastically
reduced right now.  This state of affairs concerns me, and it's not
just my family.  Maybe we need to look for the silver lining, find
opportunity in change, etc., but it is certainly going to take more

****** Harmonia Sacra - a capella four part shape note singing
I sing (the quality is arguable at times). For the past 25
years on-and-off I've been singing 4 part a capella hymns in
Mennonite circles.  It's a communal thing.  You /can/ sing the
bass line by yourself, but it's not the same.

For the past 10 years or so, my family and I have been driving
over to Shenandoah Valley 2 or 3 times a year to participate in
a few of the annual "sings" that have been happening in the
area since Joseph Funk first published [[https://harmoniasacra.org/][Harmonia Sacra]] in 1832
(in the little town of "Singers Glen"[fn:4])

Since we could not have the regular April singing in person, I
figured out how to host one on Zoom, based on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50NoWIiYECA][instructions for
leading Chorial Music over Zoom by Jim Daus Hjernøe of the
Royal Academy of Music in Denmark]]

#+caption: RAMA Vocal Center, Denmark
#+name: pic:rama
file:images/royal-academy.png


Basically, I split out a number of tracks from one of the
better sings and rebroadcast the them as guide tracks.  [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ALCFebmtOjjm74y540sKTAc6wH-rsKTQ/view?usp=sharing][Here is
a recording of "Dedication Anthem", a.k.a., "606"]], a.k.a.  "The
Mennonite National Anthem" sung in 4 part harmony by 400 people.

It worked, more or less.  There was not the same sense of
community as standing right next to other singers, but it let
out some our pent up need to sing our favorite joyful songs in
a time of uncertainty.

****** "Movers and Shapers"

There is another, larger tradition of shape note singers called
[[https://fasola.org/][Sacred Harp]].  When looking or examples of how to put together
online singings, I came across [[https://sacredharpaustralia.com/resources/singing-shape-note/][Sacred Harp Australia]], who put
up a video of a Fa-So-La "singing school".  Unlike Harmonia
Sacra sings, the Sacred Harp singers sit in a square/circle "by
parts" (Bass, Tenor, Alto, Soprano).

The Sacred Harp singers took remote singing to an entirely
different level with [[https://youtu.be/LDbOD3OO20g][The Sacred Harp Quarantine Chorus -EASTER
ANTHEM - 360° Virtual Singing and Easter Egg Hunt!]].  This an
amazing recording of 331 singers from 37 states, 4 Canadian
provences and 11 countries singing a joyful song "together".
This 360 degree video puts you you in the best seat in the
house. And here's how they did it:

****** The pros in Nashville

And then there were the pros in Nashville.  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDIJz6zzHNU][The Nashville
Studio Singer Community - Virtual Cell Phone Choir - “It Is
Well With My Soul” arranged by: David Wise]] This was a group of
professional singers, who indeed looked like they were enjoying
being part of the virtual community of singers.  They covered
the standard hymn "It Is Well With My Soul" which was written
by Horatio Spafford in response to the loss of his family when
a ship sank.

Whatever your faith, I think we can all take a little solace in
the human spirit that can't be contained and overflows into
joyous music even at times like these.  It is indeed well with

or three, or four, or...  The oldest thing I think I have in the house
is this page torn out of a family bible (I have at least 3 of them,
big, old, once-cherished).  It records the death of a William Gould in
1792, and of Joseph Dennis Gould in 1835.

I also have lecture notes Joseph Gould took at seminary, as describe
in this slightly edited email I sent to a relative a few years ago.
There were some big things going on in those days.


#+begin_quote
And here, almost certainly is the Dr. Beecher in question.  Father of
Harriet Beecher Stowe [Uncle Tom's Cabin].  Calvinist evangelist at
the head of the second great awakening, leader in the temperance
movement and at the center of a controversy at a seminary in
Cincinnati about slavery the same year [1834] these notes were
taken...18 straight nights of debate on the topic, near riots, 50
students withdrawing en mass and moving to Oberlin college.  The
church and the nation [were] starting to pull apart.

And then there was this barn [built by my ?great-great? grandfather
Morrison for my other great-great grandfather ?Ephriam Gouuld?] north
of Marietta [Lower Salem, Ohio] that housed runaway slaves. It was a
stop on the underground railroad just north of the Ohio river. And 27
years later another young man [my great grandfather Elisha Morrison,
later to marry Lydia Catherine Gould] who enlisted in the union
army....


http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Beecher

.... I have a book that appears to have started as Joseph Gould's
notes on "Dr. Beechers lectures on theology" in 1834, then used by
Daniel Gould as his account book from 1847 to his death in 1851.  Then
it contains Ephraim Gould's records as administrator of the estate,
later records of Morris Morrison and and E F Morrison through 1891,
and finally entries from Anna Gould from 1923 to 1925.  We have Anna
Goulds will dated 1925.  I think I was told she was a sister to [my
great grandmother] Catherine Gould Morrison and cared for Ephraim
Gould in his old age, which is probably also why I have his
cane..... I guess paper was scarce....

***** What is this and who is it for?

This is written primarily as a personal reflection to my cousin
about us both winding up with tons of family "stuff".
Secondarily it is intended for a family newsletter.  Tertiarily,
for my sons to document snippets of family history, and lastly
(quarternarily ?) it is written as an "open letter".

***** To John
John, you and I both have a lot of "family stuff", for different
reasons I think.  I sort of inherited it as, literally, "the last man
standing".  I care about it some.  I've been told stories about some
of it my whole life.  I think you have been a little more active
(well, a lot more active) in collecting and organizing "family
stuff".



***** Some (more) of the stuff I have
I have (top of the head, small sample) the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crokinole][Crokinole]] game board
(19th century I think), the big old custom-made oak cabinet (that
has moved exactly 3 times since it was made in the 1860s), two
old oak kitchen tables (Grandma/"Esther Morrison"'s and Ernie's),
our great grandmother's 1868 wind-up clock with which she "set up
housekeeping", wall hangings, family bibles, hymnals, cookbooks,
school books, farm records, the founding constitution of the
Union Soldiers Aid Society (1863) of the Dry Run Church, tools
(Grandpa's scythe), and until recently we had the Civil War Diary
of Elisha Morrison and his discharge papers.  Mike has the rifle
Elisha Morrison picked up after the other one he had was struck
by a bullet saving his life, or none of us would be here today.

On the Jones side I have all Dad the photography major's
negatives, the Jones/Reeder/Williams family records, my
grandmother's family photo album showing Dad's high school dance
band practicing (led by one of Nancy's former neighbors
... small world) and pictures of the TV showing live atomic bomb
test blasts and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth  (who is STILL
on the throne, is she immortal?)

If anybody in the family wants some "family stuff" talk to me.
Much of it can be had cheep (free).  I may be making an inventory
which would aid your selection.

***** What's the value?
Some of the people we have behind us include Pilgrims (John
Alden, Priscilla Mullins), "Underground Railroad" participants
(Ephraim Gould), Union Soldiers (Elisha Morrison) and on "Esther
(Free) Morrison"'s side a Hessian Soldier from the Revolution
who jumped ship and took the name "Free" with some connection to
the zany "[[http://yesteryear.clunette.com/immortaljn.html][Immortal J. N. Free]]", and then there's "Cousin Henry
[Longfellow]" (also descended from John Alden)

#+begin_quote
Tell me not in mournful numbers, life is but an empty
dream....life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not it's
goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest, was not spoken of the soul
#+end_quote

It's good to know where you came from.   It's good to know the
laudable deeds of your ancestors.   Not everybody has that.  Not
all deeds we know about were laudable or momentous,

#+begin_quote
"Though it's the laughter, we will remember, whenever we
remember, they way we were ... the rest we simply choose to
forget" (B. Streisand)
#+end_quote

***** Where is the stuff going?

I often wonder where this stuff is going.   Some of it's been
around since the 1700s.   Apparently somebody has cared about it
in every generation since then.   Maybe I'm the last.   Maybe it
will finally wind up in the dump (Bryan, Daniel, Doug, Meg
.... your call :-))

***** Where are WE going?

At one level *we* are stuff.   I think you and I may both have a
date to join all the loved ones we know in the Frankfort cemetery
in the next few years (every time I go there I look around and
say "Thelma/Bess/Mom/Dad/Grandma...what are YOU doing here?".  As
time goes on I "know" more and more people there.

Until then, back to "Cousin Henry"

#+begin_quote
Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart for any fate ;
Still achieving, still pursuing,
Learn to labor and to wait.
#+end_quote

And one of the passages that I'm sure inspired him:

#+begin_quote
54 But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable,
and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come
about the saying that is written, “DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in
victory. 55 “O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS
YOUR STING?”  [[https://biblehub.com/nasb/1_corinthians/15.htm][1 Corinthians 15]]

***** Closing

Stay safe during this strange (COVID19) time.  Enjoy time with
your family.  Enjoy your genealogy work (and thank you).  Thanks
for following up with Ebright on Dad's stone.  Hope to see you

# baseball, daffodils and dogwoods, family, friends, Skyline Chili,
# traditions, history and hope.  It is my ode to wonderful things in
# life that may never return, and a call (to myself) to look forward.

# **** Opening

Opening day [of baseball] in Cincinnati has always been a time of
hope and optimism, a time to look forward to, a time to enjoy
being with family and friends, a time to enjoy looking at the
forsythia and daffodils heralding spring, to walk across the Ohio
River on the Roebling bridge, to take in the annual Findlay
Market Parade, and to hear the umpire (or Marty and Joe on the
radio) say "Play Ball."  I am declaring today my personal
"Opening Day 2020"

***** Personal History

I started following the Cincinnati Reds in'74 and went to my
first game in 1975.  In part, this was as a way to retain some
connection with my Grandfather who died early in '74.  My first
baseball memory is of watching the final out of the '72 world
series against Oakland with him.

The mid-70s were a good time to start following the Reds.  "The
Big Red Machine" (Rose, Bench, Perez, etc) had been in the series
in '70 and '72 and wound up as World Champions in '75 (RedSox, 7
games, lots of drama) and '76 (swept the Yankees in 4 games).  I
was in the stands for one game in each of those series.  Joe
Morgan won back-to-back MVP awards, Foster had an amazing 52 home
run year in '77.  There was more than hope there.  There was
accomplishment to admire by one of the best teams in the history
of the game.


#+caption: The Big Red Machine
#+name: pic:big-red-machine
#+attr_html: :width 400
file:images/reds_1976_stein.jpg

Then there was Pete (Rose).  Mr. Cincinnati, "Charlie Hustle",
"The Hit King", batting champion, MVP, a 44 game hitting streak
in '78.  He eventually passed Ty Cobb's all-time hit count
dumping a single in to right on September 11, 1985 (and THAT for
me will, will always be THE event of 9/11).  I was there and had
driven 3 straight nights from Columbus to be in the stands for
the event.

#+caption: Statue of Charlie Hustle in action
#+name: pic:pete_and_ken
#+attr_html: :width 400
file:images/pete_and_ken.jpg


I was in the stands again for another series victory in 1990 over
the A's, which helped mitigate some of the pain caused by, shall
we say, Pete yielding to his competitive spirit a little too much
the previous year and as a result being banned for life from the
game.

There have been good times (see above) and bad times including
the early 80s after Dick Wagner prematurely dismantled the Big
Red Machine, and the last 5 years where the Reds have finished
last.  But opening day was always a day of hope.  A clean slate.
A new start.

***** Traditions

Baseball is (was?) a game of traditions.  Cincinnati had always
been accorded the privilege of having the first opening game of
the season in honor of their being the first professional
baseball team (undefeated in 1869) and having, to some degree,
inspired the birth of professional baseball itself.   That
tradition ended sometime in the 80s or 90s in favor of increased
revenue to MLB from TV contracts having other teams open.

I had my own traditions.  I attended 27 straight opening day
games from 1976-2002.   That streak ended the year I moved to
Virginia, not because it was too far, but because the event had
become a zoo and it became more of a crowd/media event than a
time for fun and relaxation.   Since then, I've attended at least
one game every year running that streak to 46 years.   That
tradition too is in jeopardy if there turns out to be no 2020
season due to COVID-19.

And then there are the obligatory pre-game stops at Skyline Chili
for coneys and chili-spaghetti before the game and Greater's ice
cream after the game.  If you're from Cincinnati, you know.

#+attr_html: :width 400

The sound of the Reds broadcasters, "Marty and Joe" (and later
others after Joe retired), has been the backdrop to so many of
our lives.  Listening on the radio, in the car, out in the yard,
late at night.  Joe signing off with is signature "Rounding third
and heading for home", and Marty's call "And this one belongs to
the Reds" after every victory.  Marty retired last year.

#+caption: Marty
#+name: pic:marty
#+attr_html: :width 400
file:images/marty.jpg

And then there were the friends and family that went with me.
Dad took us to my first game against his hometown Pittsburgh
Pirates.  Mom was in the stands with me the night Pete got 4192.
I think my brother Mark was there the night Seaver pitched a
no-hitter.  My (future) wife Stephanie learned quickly that this
was part of life.  Son Daniel still has a life-long streak of one
game a year going.  And my friend Ken (two whom this missive is
dedicated) has been to games with me for something like 40 years,
including 20 or so opening games.  And for the record, the Davy
Concepcion was a better shortstop than Larry Bowa :-)

***** What now?

I was mentally gearing up to give Tommy Thrall a chance.  He was
to slated to replace Marty this year.  The Reds spent significant
money in the off-season building a team to get out of the cellar
and back into contention.  I was willing to hope again.

I was already toying with ending my 46 year streak this year
anyhow.  A few years ago baseball started using TSA-style metal
detectors at the ballpark.  Just as Opening Day became a zoo,
there is something "too corporate" about MLB games these days, in
contrast with, say, local minor league games.  "Money-ball" has
turned the game into a series computer/stats driven calculations
where it is impossible to second-guess the manager without your
own data analysis infrastructure and machine learning models.  I
no longer understand the basic stats, and I do data analysis for
a living.  My friend Ken refuses to carry a smart phone and it
becoming nearly impossible to get/use paper tickets anymore.  Add
to that the possibility of having to wear masks and practice
social distancing in stadiums designed for anything but that
and it feels to me like the "national pass-time" will have
transformed into some kind of Orwellian panopticon.  No thank
you.  I wish major league baseball the best.  It's been a
wonderful part of my life.

***** Moving forward together

Life moves on.  We can get stuck in the past or remember it
fondly (or not), learn from it, and move forward.


#+caption: Dogwood, herald of spring
#+name: pic:dogwood
#+attr_html: :width 400
file:images/dogwood.jpg


The "national pass-time" may never be back, unless you count
socially-distanced people staring at their cell phones not
talking to each other as a "pass-time".  People don't walk or
drive their horse-and-buggy to the "ball-field" anymore.  People
don't sit on their front porch waving at passers-by.  You can't
just play hooky from school or take the day off work for a
relaxing afternoon in the sun forgetting your problems watching
the "Mudville Nine" and cheering on the Mighty Casey.

So we (I at least) will enjoy the memory of what was, and look
for new ways to slow down, new ways to enjoy life, and new ways
to spend time with family and friends.   To all those who've
enjoyed a game or two or thirty with me, thanks.  I enjoyed your
company.

Look me up if there's some kids headed out to the pasture on the
"back 40" for a pick-up game, a local little league game or a
church softball tournament.    Let's spend time together.   Let's
enjoy life together.

I recently picked up reader of samples of important ancient texts
that I've had for a LONG time and read excerpts from Socrates
Apology.  Short version:

- Oracle of Delphi :: "Socrates is the wisest man"
- Socrates :: Nice hypothesis, Apollo, you may be a god, but let's test it....
- Socrates :: Seeks out "The Wise" of his day, Politicians, Poets,
     Artisans ... questions them ... has them all expose themselves
     as blithering idiots.
- Socrates :: OK, "The Wise" are all blithering idiots.  They are
     not wise.   The hypothesis holds ... for now.
- The Wise :: (still mad), Yo, Socrates, here's some hemlock
     (poison).  Drink up...

There is nothing new under the sun.  In the mid 20th century, in
response to questions about "what is a science" Karl Popper
proposed "falsification" as a way do delineate scientific theories
from non-scientific theories.  The basic idea is that one
counter-example disproves a theory.

Socrates defense (5th century BC) is a clear example of the method
Popper had in mind.  There is nothing new under the sun.   And if
we follow Popper and Socrates, "the science" (or the pronouncement
of the god) is never "settled".   Conclusions are always
tentative and are always just one counter example away from being

You learn things when you read original sources for yourself.

I recently picked up a copy of [[http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.8.vii.html][Plato's allegory of "The Cave"]].  I had
known some of the highlights of the story before, the shadows on the
wall, prisoners thinking that the shadows were reality, since that's
all they ever knew, of one prisoner being taken out to see the sun and
seeing the true light, coming back down and trying to, literally,
enlighten his fellows, and being thought crazy.

But I had not known the context until reading the original.  He was
talking about the need for rulers of the state to have a higher
vision, to have a view of truth, of the transcendent, to willingly
leave the ivory tower, the "Isle of the blessed" if you will, where
they desired to spend their whole life in contemplation of the truth,
and to willingly go back into the cave to enlighten their brethren and
lead with a knowldge of truth, not desiring the mundane (and false)
trappings of the world of shadows (power, wealth, leisure, goods) for
their own sake and for their own use.  Rulers who do not have that
vision, and who only focus on this life are bad rulers, and everyone
(including the rulers) loose out.


#+begin_quote
Whereas the truth is that the State in which the rulers are most
reluctant to govern [because they would rather be engaged in
philosophical pursuits] is always the best and most quietly governed,
and the State in which they are most eager, the worst.
...

Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive
for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler,
and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State
which offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver
and gold, but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of
life. Whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor
and hungering after their own private advantage, thinking that hence
they are to snatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they
will be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which
thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole
State.  --- Plato, Republic, 8.vii

No, this was Augustine in "The Confessions" circa AD 397 talking about

negativity (e.g. "news") to creep back in to my life.

But humans don't change.   I have not changed.  I just choose to

Well, yes.

The Monty Python song embraces an outlook that sees a world full of bad
things, and that it views, in the end, as meaningless and absurd (see
their next movie, "The Meaning of Life" or John Cleese' most recent
(2020) one man show "Why There Is No Hope" in which they drive the

Augustine himself passed through a period where he embraced
skepticism...literally the Greek philosophy of Skepticism that doubted
everything, including the existence and know-ability of meaning
itself.  But he went further.

It's not enough to create a vacuum, to get rid of the bad, the
negative.  A vacuum will always be filled.  My answer is to /try/ to
go where Augustine wound up as articulated by the Apostle Paul:

might be troubled and distracted, if not deflected from the pursuit of
truth.

The study of history can also provide a private, personal escape from
the calamities and confusion of the present.

And of course, there can be value in loving or doing a thing for it's
own sake.  Without such passions, life becomes meaningless drudgery.
That said, here, from this morning's introspection, are a few more
possible reasons I might be fascinated with history.  History can be:

- an escape
- a "safe place"
- a source of examples for living in the world today
- a place to find idealized people and institutions (that may never
  have actually existed in the form we visualize)
- something fixed in a changing world
- a place where we know the outcomes
- a place where we can approach the world in the third person
- something to give context and explanations to our current beliefs
- a place where we do not have to enter into personal conflict
- a collection of interesting stories

      "Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention..."
      #+end_quote

      This piece began as some thoughts on "attention" and wound up as
      reflections on daydreams.  I think I'm a fan of daydreaming.

****** Attention

      Attention is a finite commodity.  You only have so much
      attention to give in your life, in your day.  Parents want your
      attention. Brothers and sisters and friends want your attention.
      Teachers want your attention.  Employers want your
      attention. Politicians want your attention.  Social media wants
      your attention. And, of course, advertisers[fn:7] want your attention
      (the most literal translation of the Latin roots of the word
      "advertisers" would be rendered "turn-toward-ers")

      Sometimes there is a reward (punishment) for your attention
      (in-attention).  Sometimes you are just "had" and your money
      goes away with your attention, never to return.

      You never get your attention back once you've given it.  You
      can't create more attention.  You can't save attention.  You can
      waste attention.  You can fragment attention. You can destroy
      attention.

      Attention is a precious, irreplaceable commodity. Guard it. Use
      it wisely.

      Which leads to...

****** Daydreams

      We say daydreamers are "lost in their own thoughts".  They don't
      do the things other people want them to do.  They don't /give
      their attention/ to things /other people/ think they should give
      their attention to.

      But (some) dreamers change the world.

      #+begin_quote
      All men dream: but not equally. Those who dream by night in the
      dusty recesses of their minds wake in the day to find that it
      was vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for
      they may act their dreams with open eyes, to make it possible.

      T.E. Lawrence, https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/T._E._Lawrence
      #+end_quote

      Daydreamers are "their own people".  And that bothers people who
      want them to be somebody else, to pay attention to certain
      other things.

****** One daydreamer
       This may not be "the perfect blog post".  It may not have the
       perfect structure and flow. It may not end concise advice you
       can live by and a nice list of actionable items.

       I've going to end it with a quote from a daydreamer who was
       torn apart for 40 years by demands on his attention from school
       teachers, societal norms, family, fans who loved him, people
       who hated him, the music industry, his band-mates, religious
       teachers, artists, social causes, politicians, the media and
       lawyers:

#+begin_example
...

People say I'm lazy
Dreaming my life away
Well they give me all kinds of advice
Designed to enlighten me
When I tell them that I'm doing fine watching shadows on the wall
"Don't you miss the big time boy, you're no longer on the ball?"

I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round
I really love to watch them roll
No longer riding on the merry-go-round
I just had to let it go

I just had to let it go

Day 05 of #100DaysToOffload.

#+hugo: more

I like to hike.  The Appalachian Trail is near my house.
Literally the day before the [[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/][Appalachian Trail Conservancy]] (ATC)
recommended EVERYONE stay off the trail (180 degrees against its
primary mission), I accepted the responsibility of maintaining a 3
mile section for the [[https://www.patc.net/][Potomac Appalachian Trail Club]] (PATC).  Just
yesterday I got word that trail maintainers have a local exception
and are allowed to be on the trail.  I'm going out this afternoon
to see how much underbrush needs cut, if there are any trees that
need chainsaw work, if any work is needed on erosion control, etc.
It will be a joy to "be out" again.

A couple weeks before the cronavirus lockdown started, I went for
a hike on the [[https://www.hikethetuscarora.org/][Tuscarora Trail]].  It was going to be a quick day
hike.  Up 900 feet, along a ridge, back down.  Maybe 8 miles.
Going up the hill I fell on a rock and sliced my forearm open and
wound up going the ER in Romney, WV with 21 stitches.  I accept some
risk when I choose to hike (there are bears too).  With the
potential strain on the medical system and emergency care being
uncertain, I'm choosing not taking risks now.

I am a "section hiker".  I go out when I can, usually 2 weeks or
so a year.  I have over half the Appalachian Trail done (1000+
miles) and had plans to go out Memorial Day (May 25) for two
weeks.  That's probably not happening.  I'm not young.  I only
have so many years to get this done.  Health is never a given.

The ATC asked all hikers this year to call it off: through hikers,
section hikers as well as day hikers.  Through hikers are people
who have re-arranged their life, their finances, their work and
family life to spend 6 months on the trail.  For many, it may be a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  But for most, through-hiking
involves staying together in shelters on rainy nights, sleeping in
bunk-houses in hostels, getting rides with local shuttle drivers,
going into trail towns to shop for re-supply, etc.  These all make
social-distancing hard.  And there is the assumption that there
will be /some/ local medical care available, like that which I
needed when I fell.  So the ATC /asked/ people to shut it down
this year.

The last time I was out hiking, the day after my initial
trail-maintainer training, the parking lot at the trail-head was
*packed*.  Not sure what I'll find today.  Crowds?  Empty Trails?
A persistent through-hiker?  People make their own choices.

***** Intro
This weekend my son Bryan, friends (former scouts from Philmont days)
Sam and Preston and friend Jack went on an canoe trip down the
Shenandoah river.  We were only dumped in the river by two of the two
rapids we encountered.  More on that below.

***** Other people having fun

Along the way we saw many people out enjoying the Memorial Day weekend
along the river.  The photo below shows a water slide set up to let
kids slide into the river, with a twist: the last 10 (3m) feet or so of the
slide were down a mud bank.  For safety there was a kayak in the water
to help the fun-havers out if needed

***** Getting Dumped the first time

The river was up.   Running about 6 feet (1.8m) at Luray.   The outfitters
along the river recommend only going at 5 feet (1.5m) or less.   Our second
day out we were making 5 miles per hour (8 km/h).

We hit the [[https://youtu.be/Zswr_IB9C_A][Compton Rapids]].  The swells were 3 feet (0.9m) or so.  We made it
about half way through, taking on water, and then got dumped.  Life
jackets are a good thing.  It was a little dicey floating though the
end of the rapids.  We kept our paddles and stayed with the
upside-down canoe.  The only losses were a couple water bottles, cup
holders and a fishing rod (other canoe).  Most everything was tied
down.

We floated 10 or 20 minutes in still-ish water and wound up swimming
our swamped canoe to the banks where there was a large group camp-out.
Some of the people (speaking pretty-much only Spanish) helped get our
sorry selves and swamped canoe out of the water and drained out.  They
gave us 6 water bottles which replaced the water we had lost.  Gracias
!


***** Getting Dumped the second time

#+attr_html: :width 400px
#+attr_latex: :width 400px
#+attr_odt: :scale 0.5
[[file:./images/swamp-number-2.jpg]]

The second time we got dumped was a about a mile from the end of the
trip.  Our planning had failed to disclose the presence of these
rapids, just had it had failed to disclose the possibility of portage
around the first set (Preston :-))

The other canoe went first.   We hung back in the smooth (but fast)
water so as not to run into them if they had trouble.   They did.
They dumped about half way through.   These canoes were a little heavy
with gear and people and not horribly stable.  Extra water in the boat
does not help.

I decided to go to the shore and work thorough options.   We reached
shore 10 or 20 yards (9 or 18) upstream from the rapids.   I grabbed a tree
root to hold us in place, but the current flipped us.   At that point
I made the call to "abandon ship".   We let the canoe go and swam to
the bank rather than float the rapids in life jackets.

We climbed up the bank, staggered downstream and found that our
friends were a) OK and b) had snagged our canoe.

***** The end

In the end, we had minimal losses, no significant injuries, no harm,
no foul?  Live and learn?  Life jackets, tying down your gear and
quick thinking are your friend.  And fun was had in the face of

1500 miles down, 700 to go to finish section hiking the Appalachian
Trail with 215 miles completed this year in 3 trips.

Of course, I have some of the hardest miles left: the Smokies,
Mt. Washington, the Whites, the Presidentials, the Bigelows, but with
persistence, luck, health, constant gear tweaks (and some HARD hiking)
I should finish in a few years.

From Sunday 2020-09-06 to Saturday 2020-09-12 I hiked 82 miles
SOBO on the Appalachian Trail from Bennington, VT (VT 9) to
Great Barrington, Mass (Mass 23).  Highlights (high point) of
the trip included Mt. Greylock, the highest point in Mass, the
lovely town campsite in Cheshire, Mass, Camping by a beaver dam
Sunday night and seeing Moose in the morning, lots of beaver
dams/bogs, staying 2 nights (Thursday, Saturday before driving
home) at the Berkshire Lakeside Lodge, a lovely little motel .2
off the trail, and, of course, lots of hiking and people.
Resupply in Dalton, Mass at the Post Office.  Chocolate shake
and meatball grinder in Cheshire.  Pizza and milk in Dalton.
Magic coming down to 20 Thursday in the most-of-the day rain.
The weather, except for Thursday rain, was excellent.  Upper 50s
to lower 80s.

Pre-trip I stopped at a Legend Of Sleepy Hollow/Rip Van Winkle
site, and just down the road the Martin Van Buren home, a short
hike in Philmont (!), NY to a high waterfall that people were
swimming under, saw some wild turkeys.  Stayed at the Days Inn
in Great Barrington and got a shuttle Sunday morning from Debbie
Andrus

Post trip, I went back to the Berkshire Lakeside Lodge.  I'd
spent time in the area.  Normal Rockwell museum.  Lakes.
Tanglewood music festival (Boston Symphony summer series).
Shaker village (I camped at the ""Shaker Campsite"").  West
Stockbridge is a lovely little town.  It has the ""TurnPark"",
an outdoor interactive art park where I met one of the artists
(cutting the weeds).  Good food.  Probably expensive and crowded
in a non-COVID high season.  "

:END:
A few years ago, my mother went through the effects of her cousin
after she died.  It turns out Thelma Jane wrote poetry.  Nobody knew.
It wound up in the trash.

Thelma lived alone.  Her husband had died in his 40s.  They had no
children. Her mother, my great-aunt Bess, lived to 102 and took her
first motorcycle ride at 100.  My mom had to go through Thelma's stuff
and Aunt Bess' stuff, most of which Thelma still had.  I now have some
of the leftovers.  But nobody wanted the poetry.  So it's gone.

This brings me to the question this article explores: /why write/?

#100daystooffload #whywrite #poetry

#+hugo: more

- Permanence? :: Thelma's poetry is gone.  Even names carved on
     tombstones crumble with time.  If your writing is very good (see,
     e.g., Virgil and Cicero) and you're lucky (see scribes in Celtic
     monasteries) your scribblings on paper, velum or in cyberspace
     might last the centuries and inspire other writers (see Dante).

- Therapy? :: I've been journaling (on paper) for a month or so.   I find
     the process quite creative and even cathartic.  And there is
     something freeing about being able to scribble, erase, underline,
     circle, draw arrows from one idea to the next, and in processing
     information a non-linear fashion.  Unexpected connections can be
     made.  I'm a huge fan of [[https://orgmode.org/][emacs org mode]] (this blog post is being
     written in org mode exported using [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] to export a [[https://gohugo.io/][hugo]] static
     web site hosted on [[https://pages.github.com/][Github pages]], but even using the best of
     digital writing tools, there is something not quite as free about
     it.  There is something mentally relaxing about writing on paper
     (and going for long walks).

- Learning? :: You learn by doing.  The process of writing (can)
     help you organize thoughts.  You often have to research things.
     Putting ideas out there opens you up to criticism.  You have to
     defend or modify your position.   It can be a starting point for
     conversation.

- Social Connections? :: See Facebook, Twitter, et al.  For all
     their downsides, there is no denying that writing, even the at the
     banal and everyday level of much of "social media" generates
     connections.   I prefer to think it will allow me to maintain
     meaningful connections to people who are important to me in life,
     but my writing may not, in fact, be that noble.

- Hubris? :: Pride?  Vanity?  Self-importance?  Self-absorption?
     These are all possibilities.

- Professional Reasons? :: I sometimes write on professional topics, see
     [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/cybersecurity-and-bears/][Bears Attacks and Cybersecurity]]  and [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/reproducable-security-analytics/][Reproducable Security Analytics]].
     A mix of the same motivations is often in play.

- To kill time? :: In this busy world we don't often feel that we
     have time to kill.  We don't sit on our front porch watching the
     world go by (and, in fact, it's been a hundred years or so since
     the front porch featured prominently in residential architecture,
     at least in the USA.), and even Baseball, the "national pass-time"
     is looking for ways to speed up the game for a public that has
     lost patience.   Maybe we need to slow down and focus on important
     things, or just enjoyable things.   Writing may be one of those
     things.

- A habit? :: For some people, writing is a habit.  I think that may
     be one of the goals of the [[https://100daystooffload.com/][#100DaysToOffload concept]].  I'm going
     to give it a try.  Thanks [[https://kevq.uk/][Kev Quirk]]


I'll never know why Thelma Jane wrote her poetry.  I'm still trying to
figure out why I write.  Maybe it's one of the reasons discussed
above.  Maybe it's all of them.

***** Experiences after 9 days of blogging

About 3 weeks ago I decided to start blogging.  For various still
ill-defined reasons, some of which I explored in a [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/poetry-in-the-trash/][blog post
contemplating the fate of writing and writers great and small]].
But it's still somewhat mushy.

I spent some time coming up the curve on the [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo framework for
building static web sites]] and the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][emacs org mode counterpart ox-hugo]]
which let me put up my [[https://eludom.github.io/][Curious Musings]] blog.

The a few days after that on [[https://fosstodon.org/web/timelines/home][Fosstodon]] (open source distributed social
media) I came across the https://100daystooffload.com/ challenge
which, basically encourages you to "just write".   Good timing.
Here it is.

#+hugo: more

I've put out a couple posts that I've put some work into like
this one about [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/2020-05-06/][Awesome online singing from Denmark to Australia, and
social distancing too!]] and [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/steve/][a tribute to Steve Wilhite]] who was my
first mentor and whom some of you know as the creator of GIF (a
very minor output of Steve's total work that just happened to
stick).  Some post have been quick.

***** "Yes, but what if /everyone/ did this"?
Yesterday, also on Fosstodon, Per Gregory@g had this say:

#+begin_quote
"Social media:
Don't use it to impress people, use it to impact people" ~ unknown

I love this, and I'm going to remind myself of it when on social media.
#+end_quote

Wise words.  Basically, "it's not about me" (unless you take the
catharsis or hubris angles I explored earlier).  OK, it /should not/
be all about me.

***** Who is /this/ post for?

So who is /this/ post for and is it useful?  You be the judge.

Maybe you're interested in getting started blogging, or wondering
what software you could use, or where you could find new online
communities that are not monitized by ads, or you want to pay
tribute to someone, or you're interested in organizing online choral
singing, or joining meet-ups of new online communities during social
distancing.  Then this post might be for you.

So my attempt at "just blogging something" for 100 straight days as
part of #100DaysToOffload https://100daystooffload.com/ has
stalled, but that's OK.

I have a home painting project going that keeps expanding in scope
every time I look at it.  I've gone on a couple weekend
[[https://outdoorfoo.wordpress.com/2020/05/17/tuscarora-trek/][backpacking]]/[[https://eludom.github.io/blog/get-wet/][canoeing]] trips, and (biggest time sync of all), I'm in
the middle of a job change.  That sucks down time and energy.  Oh
yeah, and the country/world is in a little turmoil right now
(COVID-19 and protests) which is, to say the least, distracting,
disorienting, disturbing, destructive and otherwise detrimental to
a simple goal of blogging every day.

#+attr_odt: :scale 0.5
[[file:./images/painting.jpg]]

#+hugo: more

That said, I think #100DaysToOffload was (and is) a success for
me.  I've gotten into a "writing mindset."  My paper journaling
(started just before COVID-19 hit) continues on a mostly-daily
basis.  A number of the blog entries I've written have spurred
conversations with friends.  I've posted copies of a couple of
them on [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgemjones/detail/recent-activity/posts/][my linked-in feed]] because I thought they were relevant
there.

I seem to be a failure at building a large social media following,
but that too is OK.   I write what (to me) is interesting,
thought provoking stuff and get 3 or 4 "likes" and 10 or 20 people
reading it.   I guess I'm not cut out to be an "Influencer" or
"Thought Leader" (both terms I despise).  TED talks anyone?

I am and always have been about one-on-one relationships.  The
whole idea of broadcast media (you know, TV, Radio) bothers me.
You're just "one-of-the crowd".  But then, hyper-targeted
advertising feed by corporate spying and machine learning isn't
much better.

I've taken to writing every blog post (except maybe this one :-))
with an individual in mind, kind of like an open letter.  I write
for one person.  Some of the models are Cicero's letters to his
friends and the correspondence John Adams and Thomas Jefferson
carried on late in life.  As personal letters, the writing can be
focused and specific while still dealing with topics of possible
general interest.  For instance this,
https://eludom.github.io/blog/the-stuff-of-time/ was written for
my cousin the family genealogist reflecting on us both having a
lot of family "stuff".  And this
https://eludom.github.io/blog/opening-day-2020/ was written for my
friend Ken who has been going to Reds games with me for 30 years,
reflecting on changes in the game and why we go in the first place
(friendships, diversion, traditions, hope...)

And I'm also writing for myself.   The process of thinking and
writing let's me collect my thoughts, capture them for myself and
anybody else who may care.   It also allows me to start
conversations with people, referencing my writing if appropriate.

So I'll keep writing.  Don't look for me to complete 100 posts in
100 days.   Life has not gone like that.   But there is value to
me, and I think potentially others, so I'll keep it up.

This the first in a series of articles where I do a brain dump

various forms: Dial-up BBSs, Fidonet, Usenet, IRC, CompuServe,
AOL, Slashdot, Sourceforge, blogspot, Facebook, Jabber, Google+,
Twitter, LinkedIn, Mastadon "...we didn't start the fire
(flame-war?)..."  OK, maybe we did.

I hope this is useful, or at least interesting.  It may wind up
just being a mix of introspection, hubris or narcissism, it may
be part of working up the nerve to quit Twitter as I quit
Facebook in 2016, maybe I'll even work up the nerve to go cold
turkey as [[https://musings.tychi.me/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish][tychi]] is doing.

***** Before my time

To being with, we need to set the stage.  We're here.  Now.  How
did we get here?  What went before?  Understanding these might
help us both to live in the world as we find it and figure out
how to move forward.

- '- - - ... - - -' :: Yesterday, <2020-08-16 Sun> was the 100th
     anniversary of the first trans-Atlantic telegram:
     https://cryptologicfoundation.org/what-we-do/educate/bytes/this_day_in_history_calendar.html/event/2020/08/16/1597554000/1858-early-telegraph-communications/77123
     In a very real sense, the telegram was the beginning our
     digital age.

- Telegraphs, Phones, Blind Kids and Steve Jobs :: Phil Lapsley
     wrote a fascinating book called "[[https://www.amazon.com/Exploding-Phone-Phil-Lapsley/dp/0802122280][Explode The Phone]]".  It is
     fascinating story of technology and hacking culture from
     telegraphs to somewhere after Steve Jobs and Woz were going
     door to door in the Berkeley dorms selling little black boxes.
     Phil gave a keynote at [[https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20][USENIX Security]] one year and I was
     there and talked to him a bit ... part of his passion was to
     record the "Phone Phreak" culture that lead directly to the
     modern "Hacking" (good sense) culture while enough of the
     principals were still around.  I talked to "Captin Crunch",
     one of the main subjects of the book at ToorCon one year.
     What a character.  The entire
     hacker/blackhat/freedom-to-tinker movements (and Apple
     Computer) owe him homage.  Just don't give him a piggy-back
     ride.   Phil was also the author of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol][Network News Transport
     Protocl (NNTP)]] for for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet][Usenet]] and we may get to why Usenet,
     pathalias, GNUS and friends may or may not have been a good
     idea in later posts.

I want to pick up the story where I have personal history and
Phil's book, conveniently runs right up to about that point.

I guess one of my goals parallels his: to document bits of how we
got to the "Social Media" (and "walled gardens") of today, as
I've live through and been a small player in bits of it.

Here are some developments in late 70s and early 80s where I started
to become aware/involved in "Online" things that eventually evolved
into today's Social Media: Modems[fn:5], BBS systems, TOPS-20 Bulletin Boards,
Usenet News and the birth of CompuServe.

#+caption: Desktop Dial-up
#+name: pic:modem
file:images/modem.jpg

Post 21 #100DaysToOffload https://100daystooffload.com/

#+hugo: more

- Dialup BBS Systems :: Once upon a time it was illegal to connect
     modems (or anything else but AT&T equipment) to the phone network.
     And that was, basically, the only network.  Some time after that
     changed, dialup Bullitin Board Systems (BBS) arrived.  You could
     dial up and connect to a BBS running in someone's house often
     connected to the only line (the home phone).  Mom and Dad may have
     wondered at first why they picked up a call and heard awful
     electronic squawking noises rather than someone saying "Hello".
     Once on, you could leave messages, read messages, etc.  Communities
     formed this way.

- TOPS-20 Bulletin Boards :: I'm not sure, but my first exposure
     to bulletin boards and email ("social media") was probably on
     the Ohio State DecSystem-20.  I had friends who worked there,
     and we later went to school there and thus had a "legitimate"
     accounts.  The world and software I remember is describe well
     here http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/dec20.html.  Kermit (the
     project that the authors of this article ran) was a very
     important piece of software for 10-15 years, a workhorse of
     moving files across dial-up phone connections.

- Usenet News :: Social media c.a. 1980.  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet][Usenet]] was (is) a system
     that moves messages (posts) between connected computers.  In the
     beginning this was dial-up lines.  Mostly between universities and
     research institutions and, of course, AT&T/Bell Labs etc.  For a
     while the USENET "backbone" (the long haul links, the well connected
     sites) were run by an unofficial cabal internally at AT&T (because
     they had free access to "long lines") and traffic was farmed out to
     local sites (universities) for further distribution.  It was the
     quintessential "old boy" network.  To connect, you had to know
     someone and convince them to "give you a feed".  I was on sometime
     from the mid-80s on. A few ?representative? newsgroups: =comp.sources.amiga=,
     =rec.humor.funny= =alt.ensign.wesley.die.die.die=

- CompuServe: Dialup+Network+Dec10s == Information Service :: CompuServe
     ("Online Services") was born in this world.  People started having
     "Personal Computers" in the late 70s and early 80s.  Modems started
     becoming a thing.  While Usenet, BBS systems, Fido-net and friends
     started using these technologies to connect people in non-commercial
     settings, Compu$erve started to do so in a commercial setting.
     CompuServe had been running a nationwide packet switching network
     since 1972 (take that, ARPANET !), had been selling business
     oriented computing services, and time sharing on its DecSystem10's
     accessed via that network as well as growing raft of dial-up modem
     pools, conveniently located in H&R Block offices around the country
     at a time when having "Local" numbers was important (long distance
     was expensive).  This was the 1970s version of "Cloud Computing".
     Business use slacked off at night, so what was a good time-sharing
     company to do?  Why start an Information Service that grew into the
     familiar lineup of "Forums" (BBS), "InfoPlex" (email), "CB"
     (chat/Aim/IRC), and the recurring services that every online service,
     search engine and social network eventually devolves to: News,
     Weather, and Sports.  I think the online service started around 1980.   I began working
     there in 1985.   More from the CompuPerspective as these posts
     progress.

*** Tech HOWTOs                                                       :HOWTO:
**** PUBLISHED HOWTO: Breaking and fixing DNS - Understanding modern DNS on Ubuntu. :DNS:Ubuntu:HOWTO:Linux:systemd:
:PROPERTIES:
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: dns-today
:EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE: 2020-05-10
:END:
One dark and stormy night I broke my DNS.   I decided to move
beyond =/etc/resolv.conf= and see what demons (daemons?) were
lurking under the hood.  "Its complicated."  This is the story of
understanding, debugging and fixing it.

# If you've ever wondered "what's up with systemd, DNS, and name
# resolution on Ubuntu" and "how does it all work", you may want to
# read this journey of discovery.  Or not.  When you turn over rocks,
# sometimes ugly things crawl out...

#+hugo: more

***** /etc/resolv.conf


If you  look at =/etc/resolv.conf= on a Linux system today (Ubuntu
19.10) you will find something like:

#+begin_example
# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
# 127.0.0.53 is the systemd-resolved stub resolver.
# run "systemd-resolve --status" to see details about the actual nameservers.

nameserver 127.0.0.1
search lan
#+end_example

But the file seems to change.  I've seen it without most of the
verbiage above.  I've seen the file contain both 127.0.0.1 and
127.0.0.53.  Confusing.  systemd?

***** You /can/ edit =/etc/resolv.conf=
First let me say that despite the dire warnings below, you *can*
edit =/etc/resolv.conf=, e.g. to make it look like

#+begin_example
# Generated by NetworkManager
search lan
nameserver 9.9.9.9
#+end_example

And it will work until NetworkManager chooses to overwrite the
file.  Not sure if =sudo chmod 444 /etc/resolv.conf= be enough to
keep NetworkManager from overwriting it.

***** You /can/ make =/etc/resolv.conf= immutable

If you /do/ edit =/etc/resolv.conf= you can make it immutable to
prevent systemd from updating it:

#+begin_example
$ sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf
$ sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
rm: cannot remove '/etc/resolv.conf': Operation not permitted
#+end_example


***** Debugging a broken DNS
I was living dangerously and simultaneously playing with
https://pi-hole.net/ and letting Ubuntu try to upgrade my system.
It went south.  DNS stopped working.  The following were some of
the debugging steps I took to try to understand/fix the issue:

****** Testing resolution - is name resolution working?

In this phase of debugging, I try to do name resolution as configured:

- dig - no namserver specified :: I ran =$ dig www.uu.net= to see if everything was working as
     intended.  Nope.  No response.

- dig - known-good nameserver :: I ran =$ dig www.uu.net
                  @9.9.9.9= to see if I could resolve against a known-good
     nameserver.  This worked.  No issues with connectivity/routing.

- dig - 127.0.0.53 :: I ran =$ dig www.uu.net @127.0.0.53= to see
     if the local systemd-resolved nameserver specified in
     /etc/resolv.conf was working.  Nope.

- systemd-resolved - how is it configured?  :: I ran =$
                  systemd-resolve --status= to see how systemd thought dns was
     configured.  The wireless interface I was using pointed to a
     nameserver (the proxy server on my wireless router) that should work:

#+begin_example
$ systemd-resolve --status
...
Link 3 (wlp2s0)
      Current Scopes: DNS
       LLMNR setting: yes
MulticastDNS setting: no
      DNSSEC setting: no
    DNSSEC supported: no
         DNS Servers: 192.168.86.1
          DNS Domain: ~.
                      lan
#+end_example

- systemd-resolve - let systemd resolve a name :: dig(1) and host(1) are
     not the only game in town for doing command line DNS look-ups.
     Systemd (of course) will do it for you:
     #+begin_example
                 $ systemd-resolve www.uu.net
                 www.uu.net: 152.195.32.39
     #+end_example
     In this case, it worked, which tells me that systemd-resolved
     is happy and working.

- try dig again :: Try another "normal" lookup:
     #+begin_example
                 $ dig www.uu.net
     #+end_example

     This failed.  The conclusion seems to be that the whatever the
     resolver library is looking at (127.0.0.53) is not working.

- edit =/etc/resolv.conf= :: Pointing =/etc/resolv.conf= at
     working nameservers fixed the problem:

#+begin_example
# Generated by NetworkManager
search lan
#nameserver 127.0.0.53  # BROKEN. systemd-resolved nameserver set by NetworkManager
#nameserver 9.9.9.9     # WORKS. quad9 nameserver
nameserver 192.168.86.1 # WORKS. wireless router nameserver
#+end_example

******* Conclusion - the systemd-resolved is not answering

****** What name resolution processes are running?

The next question is: what's (not) running?  What's (not) listening?

To answer these questions, I poked at the network and the
running processes:

- nmap - look for listeners :: nmap did not show a DNS listener at 127.0.0.53
#+begin_example
gmj@ed home-computing [master] $ sudo nmap -v -sU -PS  127.0.0.53

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-05-10 07:51 EDT
Initiating Parallel DNS resolution of 1 host. at 07:51
Completed Parallel DNS resolution of 1 host. at 07:51, 0.02s elapsed
Initiating UDP Scan at 07:51
Scanning 127.0.0.53 [1000 ports]
Completed UDP Scan at 07:51, 2.80s elapsed (1000 total ports)
Nmap scan report for 127.0.0.53
Host is up (0.000049s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed ports
PORT     STATE         SERVICE
68/udp   open|filtered dhcpc
631/udp  open|filtered ipp
5353/udp open|filtered zeroconf
#+end_example

zeroconf :: Is zeroconf listening?  What is 5353?

It looks like 5353 is multicast DNS.

#+begin_example
$ egrep -i domain\|dns /etc/services
domain		53/tcp				# Domain Name Server
domain		53/udp
mdns		5353/tcp			# Multicast DNS
mdns		5353/udp
#+end_example

- lsof -i :: look at listening ports

     Next, I used lsof(1) to look at listening and connected ports,
     successively grepping out the "known" and "uninteresting":

#+begin_example
gmj@ed home-computing [master] $  sudo lsof -i -n  | egrep -vi established\|dropbox\|ssh\|http\|smtp\|bootp\|ipp
COMMAND     PID            USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
avahi-dae  1064           avahi   12u  IPv4  25434      0t0  UDP *:mdns
avahi-dae  1064           avahi   13u  IPv6  25435      0t0  UDP *:mdns
avahi-dae  1064           avahi   14u  IPv4  25436      0t0  UDP *:42027
avahi-dae  1064           avahi   15u  IPv6  25437      0t0  UDP *:44240
dnsmasq    2538 libvirt-dnsmasq    5u  IPv4  37248      0t0  UDP 192.168.122.1:domain
dnsmasq    2538 libvirt-dnsmasq    6u  IPv4  37249      0t0  TCP 192.168.122.1:domain (LISTEN)
brave     28951             gmj   43u  IPv4 250584      0t0  UDP 224.0.0.251:mdns
#+end_example

Looks like avahe-dae[mon] is listening on multicast-dns (mdns) on
5353, and there are outbound connections to 192.168.122.1:53, which
*was* a wired connection to the router, but nothing listening on
port 53.  This is a problem.

****** Why is systemd-resolved not answering - do I care?

Do I really want to debug systemd-resolved? No.  I was half
planing on upgrading to the latest Ubuntu release (20.04)
anyhow.  This seems like the time to do it, rather than
debugging this problem further.

****** Lessons learned

- run servers on dedicated systems :: I had been messing with
     https://pi-hole.net/ on this system (a laptop that mostly does
     not move/go off the net).  There was some confusion/doubt
     about whether this interacted badly with things/caused the
     problems.   It may have.  I un-installed it.   But running a
     dedicated server would be better.

- Failed Ubuntu "upgrade" :: The actual trigger that made things not
     work was an attempt to let the Ubuntu installer upgrade the
     system.  This failed in strange ways.  After running, my
     system which was Ubuntu 19.10 reported (/etc/issue) to being
     18.04 and the pi-hole logs reported that they could not find
     the wireless interface it had been configured to use (but the
     device was still there, same name, still working...)

***** Next Steps

****** TODO Do a hard upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04
- Full backup, wipe disk, restore...
- Use ansible, docker, chief or similar to make configs
  repeatable.

****** TODO Set up a server to run pi-hole and other services
- Possibly re-purpose an old laptop or pogo-plug device running
  something minimal like Arch Linux
- Use ansible, docker, chief or similar to make configs
  repeatable.

***** Things to learn more about
- avhai :: So what is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_%28software%29][avhai]]-dae[mon]?  It looks like a
     zero-configuration (I wish !) networking services that uses
     multi-cast DNS on a local network.  Do I need to be running this?

- systemd-resolved :: I may want to learn more about this, as it is
     part of the new regime in most Linux distros.  But not now.
