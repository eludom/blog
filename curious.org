**** PUBLISHED Fixing GNU bash associative array insert speed :programming:gnu:linux:

 Bash uses linear search to insert values in to associative arrays.
 This is all well and good for small numbers of keys.   I was adding
 millions[fn:1].    I went poking around the bash source code today
 (2020-04-18) to confirm my suspicion and gauge the difficulty of
 adding an option to do something more sensible.


 In less than a day after I reported it, there is a patch
 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2020-04/msg00114.html My
 timing code and pre and post patch timings are here:
 https://github.com/eludom/snippits/tree/master/bash/tests

 #+hugo: more

 Here the steps I took and where I might go if I get serious about
 fixing the problem:

***** Get the source code

****** Find it
       - find the homepage :: A quick bit of googling lead to the homepage http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/bash/
       - use git :: For a minute it looked like GNU was still stuck in the bad old
         days of having to download a tarball and then apply a series
         of patches, but fortunately, it there is a git repo http://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=bash
****** Download it
       #+begin_src bash :eval no
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/bash.git
       #+end_src
****** Build it

       Bash follows a time honored build convention
       #+begin_src bash :results output :eval no
./configure
make
       #+end_src

****** Analyze it
       - I read the NEWS file for any indication that associative arrays
         has been worked on to speed up associative array
         insert/look-ups.  No indication that they had.
       - I checked the git commit logs, which appear to be meaningful
         after Bash-4.4 patch 19.  Nothing.
       - With judicious use of grep ("grep-find in Emacs") for
         "associative" and "hash_search" it turns out that associative
         array inserts (as all inserts) are done with use of the
         "hash_search" function in =hashlib.c=
       - has_insert() begins as follows:
 #+begin_src C
/* Create an entry for STRING, in TABLE.  If the entry already
   exists, then return it (unless the HASH_NOSRCH flag is set). */
BUCKET_CONTENTS *
hash_insert (string, table, flags)
     char *string;
     HASH_TABLE *table;
     int flags;
{
  BUCKET_CONTENTS *item;
  int bucket;
  unsigned int hv;

  if (table == 0)
    table = hash_create (0);

  item = (flags & HASH_NOSRCH) ? (BUCKET_CONTENTS *)NULL
                               : hash_search (string, table, 0);
 #+end_src
       - and there it is, the linear search walking the list in
         =hash_search()=
 #+begin_src C
/* Return a pointer to the hashed item.  If the HASH_CREATE flag is passed,
   create a new hash table entry for STRING, otherwise return NULL. */
BUCKET_CONTENTS *
hash_search (string, table, flags)
     const char *string;
     HASH_TABLE *table;
     int flags;
{
  BUCKET_CONTENTS *list;
  int bucket;
  unsigned int hv;

  if (table == 0 || ((flags & HASH_CREATE) == 0 && HASH_ENTRIES (table) == 0))
    return (BUCKET_CONTENTS *)NULL;

  bucket = HASH_BUCKET (string, table, hv);

  for (list = table->bucket_array ? table->bucket_array[bucket] : 0; list; list = list->next)
    {
      /* This is the comparison function */
      if (hv == list->khash && STREQ (list->key, string))
        {
          list->times_found++;
          return (list);
        }
    }
 #+end_src


***** Next steps
****** DONE Reach out to the maintainers
       see if they would even entertain the idea of a patch
****** CANCELED Look for appropriate in-memory hash insert/lookup functions
       - btrees ?
****** CANCELED Code it
****** CANCELED test it
****** CANCELED submit patch
       See https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2020-04/msg00114.html

***** Footnotes
[fn:1] yes, there are many better tools for this job, but not in the constrained environment where this had to run.


**** WIP HOWTO: Using Pi-hole DNS to block ads.  The struggle continues... :DNS:privacy:networking:HOWTO:

 /This article is a work in progress.  Updated: 2020-05-02.  This is
 turning into a bit of a catch-up on the state of DNS for me./

 Day 03 and 04 of #100DaysToOffload.

***** Intro
 # Thanks to Paul Vixie for the pointer to

 The war against ads continues. https://pi-hole.net/ looks like a
 reasonable, good, new?, open source entry in the war against ads. Get
 'yer source/install for linux at https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole

 Per Paul Vixie
 #+begin_quote
 not even non-technical users need a "public DNS" to shield themselves
 from a lot of known-evil internet sites. check out @The_Pi_Hole or
 have your 12yo child or cousin install it.
 #+end_quote

 ..but I always make things harder.

 #+hugo: more

***** What
      - It's a local DNS server to block adds.

***** Why
      - Blocking ads is a moral good.
      - I've not done home network hacking for a while.
      - I'm moving into a bit of a more "don't track me" frame of mind.

***** When
      - Now, because I'm home more during corona-virus.

***** How
      - Set up local server.
      - First on a Linux laptop that (usually) does not go off the net.
      - Then maybe on an old pogoplug or laptop.

***** Install It

      Here's what I did to instlal

      - [ ]  basic install :: On a Linux server, the *basic* install is
        simple:

        #+begin_example
       sudo bash basic-install.sh
        #+end_example

      - [ ] Static IP :: But you will want a Linux box with a static IP
        address. This may involve, e.g., convincing your wireless
        router to hand out a the same static IP to a static IP

      - [ ] Tell other systems to use this IP for DNS :: Again,
        probably configuring your wireless router to specify your local
        IP as the DNS server for DNS assignments via DHCP assignments.
        You could also do this by configuring the individual devices to
        use it.

      - [ ] Remember your admin password :: Make note of the admin password during install

      - [ ] hit the local admin web server :: Its a very nice.  It will
        be at a something like  http://192.168.86.230/admin/index.php.

***** Test It

      - [ ] Look something up by hand :: Use dig(1) or host(1).  Note
        the =SERVER= in the response below that shows where the answer
        came from.  If it's your IPS's DNS or Google, try again
        (something's not configured right).  In my case 127.1 is right.

      #+begin_example
$ dig www.uu.net

; <<>> DiG 9.11.3-1ubuntu1.11-Ubuntu <<>> www.uu.net

      #+end_example

      - [ ] Check the query logs via the UI to make sure your target domain
        showed.   Be aware of caching.  It may only show up the first
        time you query.

      - [ ] Go trolling for ads :: Find your favorite 90s-era web site,
        go hit it, and watch the counters

        + http://computershopper.com
        + http://www.yahoo.com
        + http://www.compuserve.com
        + http://www.aol.com
        + http://sears.com (get it while it lasts)

      - If the counters go crazy and you don't see the expected
        plethora of ads, you win.  If not dig deeper.

      - If you are all-ready using ad-dblockers :: If you are already
        using ad-blockers or browsers such as Brave that block ads, you
        may have to test with something else (Firefox, Chrome, etc.)

      - Browser and other apps are getting cagey about using not using
        the system DNS, using DOH, and otherwise not acting like you
        expect them too.  Editing =/etc/resolv.conf= is not the whole
        game anymore.


***** Tools you may want to use/learn/install
      - dig :: for making/testing queries by hand
      - [[https://www.wireshark.org/][Wireshark]] :: Use Wireshark to see what's going on on the wire,
        who you're talking to, etc.
***** The things you learn
      - pi-hole can apparently function as a DHCP server itself.

      - You can choose your upstream DNS servers from a list with
        options for IPv4, IPv6, DNSSEC/no DNSSEC, filtered/unfiltered.

     - Quad9 is one of the choices.  It looks to be really useful for
       adding malware blocking to your domain.  See
       https://www.quad9.net/faq/ for a useful bit of education.


     - The logs are at =/var/log/pihole.log=

     - Possibly use [[http://www.ranum.com/security/computer_security/papers/ai/][Marcus Ranums's principal of "Artificial Ignorance"]]
       to grep out the known and see what's left:

       What is this stuff?

***** Tune it
      I'm not sure all the devices in the house are using the P-hole
      proxy.  If they are, then they are showing up as the single
      device _gateway.   I need to understand this and figure out if I
      can get other devices pulling wireless addresses via DHCP from
      the WAP to use the Pi-hole DNS directly.   Stay tuned.

**** WIP "My Computer ?"         :computers:windows:apple:cloud:ubuntu:linux:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: my-computer
     :EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE: 2020-05-12
     :END:

     The windows desktop has (had? I don't pay attention) icons labeled
     "My Computer".  I always thought that was odd, or at least very
     often out of context as many (most?) instances of Windows ran on
     machines at people's jobs.  They didn't own the computer.  It was
     not "My Computer".

     Similarly, Apple has a long history of asserting they know what's
     best for other people and their computers.  The last time I had to
     go to "The Apple Store" all I wanted was a power cable.  I wanted
     the part, I wanted to pay, I wanted to get out.  But,
     characteristically, the "experts" there (what does that say about
     their view of their customers) wanted to engage me, to "have a
     conversation", talk to me about warranties and if I qualified, they
     wanted to wast my time (more valuable than my money) on their
     agenda.  Apple software is the same way.   Not "My Computer".

     Then there is the cloud.  "There is no cloud, there's just other
     people's computers."  I've worked at AWS.  I worked at CompuServe
     about 5 years into the information service days.  Before that, it
     was a time-sharing company.  "There is no isolated Project,
     Programmer Number environment with custom BASIC and FORTRAN
     Compilers, InfoPlex (email), and FILGE (FILe Generator and Editor)
     connected via X.25 PADs (VPNs back in the day), there's just
     CompuServe's DecSystem-10s."

     And then there is this glorious 3 or 4 year old laptop that I'm
     about to blow up, wiping the disk and reinstalling Ubuntu
     (switching to Kubntu, because, why not?).  No change control.  No
     production concerns (well, maybe a few, I'm putting out this blog
     post early in case it does not come back quickly).  I have a long
     running game of naming my systems.  This one's currently called ed
     (for the editor), octo (8 processors), mel (for "real
     programmers").  I think when I reinstall this time, I'll call it
     "MyComputer".

     #+hugo: more

***** Potential ox-hugo sites to copy
****** The Art Of Not Asking Why
       I started by looking for sample web sites to copy by perusing
       the sites on this list
       https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/examples/

       I found the following

       - Site :: https://joshrollinswrites.com/
       - Source :: https://github.com/jarss/TAONAW/tree/master

      Josh has been great in answering the odd question.  His blog is
      interesting too !!!  He accepts paypal...

***** General Info on Hugo, Ox-Hugo and github pages
       Then I did some reading (this is where the /not simple/ part
       comes in) on the following sites

      - hugo getting started :: https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/
      - hosting a blog on github pages :: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/
      - github pages :: https://pages.github.com/
      - HOWTO with Hugo and github pages :: https://medium.com/swlh/hosting-a-hugo-blog-on-github-pages-with-travis-ci-e74a1d686f10
      - Org mode hugo exporter :: https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/
        + I'll probably go here, but it seems like a bit much to start...
        + Maybe learn the un-automated way first?
      - About Hugo :: https://people.umass.edu/weikaichen/post/emacs-ox-hugo/
      - About blogging with Hugo :: https://www.shanesveller.com/blog/2018/02/13/blogging-with-org-mode-and-ox-hugo/

***** The results

      You're looking at the results: https://eludom.github.io/, this
      and other posts.  It took a couple deep dives to understand it,
      but I think I more-or-less have it, and it is a very seamless
      integration wtih Org-Mode, which for some of us closes the deal
      even if there is pain involved

***** Bonus: Twitter cards

      And for bonus points I did reading on how to add twitter card
      support to ox-hugo bog posts, e.g., so you can write your post
      and have twitter or other sites (such as [[https://mastodon.social/about][Mastadon]]) that
      understand the format pull the title, intro and possibly an
      image to post in the web sit.

****** Twitter Cards: HOWTO, the short story

      Short version: if you drop =twitter_cards.html= in
      =layouts/partials/= of your blog, you then just write your
      blog, publish it, and past the URL into the https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator
      to make sure it's going to work when posted

****** Twitter Cards: More than you ever wanted to know, the long story.

   - Twitter Cards :: https://sproutsocial.com/insights/twitter-cards/

***** How to publish: files, settings, process
      And, finally the gory details of actually publishing.

      These are raw/WIP notes, but mostly right.  They actually
      publish this blog.

****** Important Files and Directories
       - /home/gmj/public/github/ox-hugo-blogs/blog/curious.org :: The one file to rule them all
         o This is the blog.  All articles live in this one file as
         separate org trees.   This is the "source".
       - HUGO_BASE_DIR=/home/gmj/public/github/ox-hugo-blogs/blog ::  The root of my blog
         o This is the root/source for the blog.  It gets pushed to
         git@github.com:eludom/blog.git (fetch)
       - =${HUGO_BASE_DIR}/content/= :: Where local content (markdown) goes,
         e.g. =content/posts/steve.md=
       - =${HUGO_BASE_DIR}/docs/= :: Where the content to publish (html) goes,

****** Settings and Organization
******* Set EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION
        In the .org file that is the blog, set EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION
        to be "Blog" (or in whichever section you want posts to land,
        default is "posts")

        This is inherited lower level headers in org so

        #+begin_example

    This is a brain dump on something like 40 years experience with
    "social media" of various forms.
       #+end_example

       - EXPORT_HUGO_SECTION :: probably not needed if inherited from

      "I mean, why not just use blogger.com or Wordpress"?  Been

      Companies come and go.  I ought to know.  I started my career
      working at CompuServe.  The forums where apparently finally
      deleted on 2017.  History was lost.

      There are issues of control.  There are the issues of using
      tools I like, not the GUI or "download my app" du jour with
      tracking, ads, monetization, bloat and more.

     :EXPORT_FILE_NAME: cybersecurity-and-bears
     :EXPORT_HUGO_PUBLISHDATE: 2020-03-19:
     :END:

     I spend a good amount of time hiking in Shenandoah National Park and
     surrounding areas. I've seen quite a few #bears and I've followed one
     down the trail. I've been growled at by a mother bear when I
     unknowingly came between her and her cubs. This is going somewhere
     related to #cybersecurity. I promise.

     You can't outrun a bear. Climbing a tree won't help. If a bear
     actually decides to attack you, the odds are not in your favor, but
     fortunately they almost never attack. The old joke goes "I don't have
     to outrun the bear, I just have to outrun you" because, presumably the
     bear will catch your slower partner, stop, and not bother you when you
     both decide to run for it in violation of bear encounter best
     practices.

     This hints at any number of cybersecurity principals:

     - Know your threat model.
     - Know and follow best practices.
     - Don't let fear (or adrenaline) dictate your response.
     - Know and practice situationally appropriate responses (Grizzlies:
       if attacked play dead. Black Bear: if attacked fight for your
       life)
     - Be prepared (bear spray, first aid kit)
     - Practice deterrence (make noise, travel in groups)
     - Prevention costs less than recovery. By far.
     - And, of course, make sure the other guy is an easier target. Run faster if you run. Apply patches, have good backups (Hello, ransomware !), have layers of defense, decoys, monitoring, DLP, practice threat hunting, etc.
       For a decade or so, I've been reflecting on the fact that
       defensive cybersecurity is a loosing igame. The red team
       (attackers) always win. I don't like no-win situations.

     There's a lesson here:

     - Don't feed the bears :: They become habituated to humans, loose
       their inhibition, become a nuisance and sometimes have to be
       relocated or killed. Nobody wins.

     OK, not that lesson. Lessons like:

     - Follow best practices :: Following best practices CAN help avoid
       problems. Not following best practices WILL invite problems.
     - Have an incident response plan :: If you see a bad thing
       happening, if it is coming straight for you, what do you do?
     - Line up the right resources ::  Do you know how to triage
       wounds? Do you have a cell phone? Are you in range of cell
       towers? If not, do you have a SPOT to call for help? Where is
       the nearest hospital? Are you prepared to shelter in place if
       need be?
     - It's not just you :: Feeding the bears or failing to store food
       properly might result in perfectly good backcountry shelters
       being torn down. And here we are, 20 or so years after it
       became clear that that allowing spoofed packets out of your
       network enables #DDoS #attacks and we *still* do not have
       widespread adoption of reverse path forwarding
       checks. *Please* stop spoofed packets at your border !


     So it maybe true that few people win in the face of an actual attack,
     but, it turns out, there are still good reasons to play the game.

 # Tim, Jono, Leigh

 In my never ending quest for synthesis, this post combines thoughts on
 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop][the OODA loop]] and falling out of a canoe twice this weekend in rapids
 on the Shenandoah river.  There is a connection.  Maybe.

 If you want to see the full trip report, pictures, etc. go here [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/get-wet/][Things
 that fall in the river get wet]].  If you're interested in how this relates to
 the OODA loop or, better, if you have experience/thoughts on applying
 the OODA loop to operational cybersecurity settings, read on (and
 comment !)

***** The OODA Loop

 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop][The OODA loop]] is a concept cybersecurity has borrowed from the US Air Force.
 "OODA" stands for "Observe, Orient, Decide, Act".
 The OODA loop began as a very fighter-pilot-centric view of a problem
 space.  I always think of Snoopy and the Red Barron.  Snoopy
 *observes* the Red Barron at a distance, *orients* his Sopwith-Camel
 towards the Red Barron, *decides* to fire, and then *acts* by firing-away.
 Then repeat the OODA loop.  *Observe*: what was the effect of your
 action (the Red Barron went down in flames, or you missed and now he's on your
 tail)...

***** The OODA Loop and falling out of a canoe
 The OODA loop parallels my decision making process in the rapids this
 weekend.  In one of our two crisis events I *observed* the other
 canoe flip in the rapids ahead.  I *oriented* my canoe towards shore.
 I *decided* to grab a tree root to buy time to sit and contemplate
 options.  I *acted* by grabbing the tree root.  We flipped due to the
 strong current.
 REPEAT.
 I *observed* that we were in the water 10 or 20 yards (9 to 18 meters)
 from the start
 of the rapids.  I *oriented* myself towards shore.  I *decided* to
 swim to shore at all costs (loosing the canoe and all our gear) rather
 than float the rapids in life jackets.  I *acted* by swimming to shore.
 REPEAT.
 I *observed* that we were safe on shore without our boat, gear or
 friends.  I *oriented* myself downstream.  I *decided* to walk in
 search of boat, gear and friends.  I *acted* by walking...

***** Where does the OODA loop work well?

 The OODA loop seems to be a good model for rapidly changing situations
 where the personal stakes to the actor are high, the actor is
 receiving relevant information in a timely fashion and has the ability
 to decide on appropriate action and execute in a very short
 timescale.  There were elements of this in Bill Cheswick's classic [[https://www.cheswick.com/ches/papers/berferd.pdf][An
 Evening with Berferd]] and Cliff Stoll's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg][The Cuckoo's Egg]], but I am
 wondering how many of these conditions apply, to, say the modern SOC?


***** Does the OODA loop work in SOCs?

 How do the characteristics of crisis situations such has that
 described above or a fighter pilot in dogfight map to the modern SOC?
 Does a SOC have a rapidly changing situation?  Probably.  Are there
 personal stakes for the actor (analyst)?  It depends.  Is it just
 "work my shift and go home after the hand-off"?  Are the actors
 (analysts) receiving relevant information in a timely fashion?  Or are
 they waiting for a weeks-long (months-long?) approval process for the
 ingest of needed data, the provisioning of enough storage and compute
 power to run the queries they need?  Are they empowered to take action
 in a short timescale?  Or are there three levels of management
 approval needed and reports to be written before any action can taken?
 Can they take machines offline, implement blocks, etc?  Even if it
 impacts production?  Can they observe, orient, decide and act, or is
 it time to put your feet up, hope for the best and float through the
 rapids?

 Your thoughts?  Experiences?

 "I'm passionate about..." I've always hated that phrase. Because I
 thought it was fake. I thought it was trendy. I've reflexively reacted
 against trendy things for decades. Pet Rocks, Disco, TED talks,
 cryptocurrency... But I am coming to see what the phrase is getting
 at. And I think I like it.

 In a work world where human beings are called "resources", where
 intelligent, creative, inquisitive, motivated people are subjected to
 management practices derived from 19th century steel mills and
 automotive assembly line production, the phrase "I'm passionate
 about..." is (can be) an attempt to re-assert humanity.

 I've just finished reading [[https://www.amazon.com/Long-Live-Latin-Pleasures-Language/dp/0374284520#ace-8881249860][Long Live Latin: The Pleasures of a Useless
 Language]] . For no good reason. Again and again, it raises the question
 of what it means to be human: to be joyful, spontaneous, creative,
 inquisitive, fulfilled, to discover, to appreciate beauty, music, art,
 language, and poetry (yes, I have a liberal arts degree)

 I guess if I had to say what I'm passionate about, it's about being
 human and treating other people as humans. To put a professional spin
 on it "I am passionate about collaborating with technical people to
 find creative solutions to important problems."

 Go learn a useless language. Climb a mountain and enjoy the
 view. Spend time playing games with your family. Be human. Be
 passionate. Carpe diem.

   Steve worked at CompuServe (and successors) from 1970 to 2001.  I
   was fortunate enough to start my career working with/for him.  My
   view of his programming output comes largely from 1985-1995.  I'm
   sure there was much more that I missed.

***** Things Steve Wrote
   Steve ran the languages and tools group when I arrived.  /He had just/
   /given up on writing at DEC10 ADA compiler/[fn:2] (Steve is still writing
   ADA software), was just beginning to embrace PCs as "real computers"
   worthy of his attention, had written a FORTRAN compiler, a BASIC
   compiler and associated run-time systems, and a run-time library for
   BLISS called BTOOLS.  These were partially in support of
   CompuServe's pre-information-service time-sharing services supported
   by a homegrown packet-switched networking.  "Cloud computing" in the
   1970s :-)

   I worked on BTOOLS, SKIMAN (Single Key Index Access Manager), a
   B-Tree library Steve had created.  There was a full-fledged database
   system written in there somewhere I think.  There were ports and
   hacks to various tools such as FINE (Fine Is Not Emacs), a C
   compiler, DEC Runoff, laser printer support, source code control
   systems, etc.

   On top of that, Steve created the HMI (Host Micro Interface)
   protocol that rode on top of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/b_protocol][CompuServe "B-Protocol"]] to allow API
   driven interactions with the information service (the alternative
   being text/command line interfaces).  This was all in an environment
   where 9600baud modems were considered "fast".  Compression,
   incremental display, etc. were paramount.

   He later used that as the substrate for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compuserve_information_manager][WinCim]], the graphical interface
   to the information service that he created which kept the company
   going for a while in the face of the likes of AOL.  Somewhere in
   there, there was a graphics library and enough pieces that I was
   able to write a web browser that worked inside WinCim, that would
   have allowed CompuServe users without an Internet connection (most
   everyone then) to browse the web.  Marketing did not want to release
   my web browser.  *Sigh*.

   Later on (after my time) Steve as pulled into major projects to support
   the back end processing for H&R Blocks's TaxCut program when online
   tax-filing was a new thing.  /He was also pulled into the WOW project/
   /which was supposed to be the AOL killer when it became apparent that/
   /CompuServe needed an AOL killer./[fn:3]  One of those projects succeeded.
   Single-handed technical virtuosity could not fix the one that
   didn't.

   And there was this little side project called GIF.

***** Things that got out

****** GIF
   Be careful what you do and say.  It's often the incidentals that you
   are remembered for.  The kind (or unkind) words.  The side projects.

   In the world of the mid 80s there were IBM PCs, Apple Macs
   (classic), Amigas, Atari-STs, CoCos, and yes, Apple-IIs and
   Commodor-68s.  The information service was moving beyond a
   text-based, menu-driven system (I like curses and termcap as much as
   the next guy, but hey..).  People wanted to share pictures, display
   online-shopping catalogs, weather maps, etc.  There were no/few good
   portable graphics formats.  So Steve wrote one.  GIF.  Then the web happened.
   The web wanted portable images too.  GIF worked.  So the early web
   adopted it.  There was the kerfuffle over the LZW compression
   algorithm it used resulting in the creation of the PNG format, but,
   hey, who in 1987 would ever think that an algorithm published in ACM
   might not be free.  OK, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/richard_stallman][Stallman]], but who else :-).  And now there
   are Giffy's in slack that I turn off because I hate dancing bears.
   Thank-you Steve.

***** MicroEmacs/mg display hacks

   And then there are the [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/MicroEmacs][MiroEmacs]] display hacks.  When the Amiga came
   out Steve convinced me to buy one (it was that or the AtariST, he
   had and was hacking on both).  But there was no Emacs.  Somehow
   (Steve?) I became aware that the source to MicroEmacs was included
   on with the disks to Mark Williams C compiler for the PC.  So I bought
   the C compiler, ported the source to the Amiga (all it needed was
   character I/O drivers to work in the native ANSI/VT-100 terminal)
   and gave the source to Steve, who, I think, hacked/improved the
   screen update logic.  I then posted the source to the USENET group
   comp.sources.amiga. It took off from there (thanks to Daniel
   Lawerence).  It's rumored that Linus Torvalds uses a version of the
   code to this day.


***** CompuServe: Groundbreaking events, great teams and amazing individuals.

      At the recent (2019-10-19) CompuServe 50th Anniversary reunion I
      was reminded of the revolutionary things that happened there: the
      first commercial email, the first online banking, the first
      online shopping, the first electronic news wire feed, the first
      song released exclusively online (Arrowsmith 1994), online chat
      (CB), OS and compiler development, VPNs (X.25 !), data over cable
      in 82....and Dan Piskur inventing what we know today as much of
      standard online security, incident response and "cyber"/law
      enforcement collaboration, all before the Internet.

      Of course it all took the efforts of many people and groups:  the
      network software team (packet switching c.a. 1972, take that
      DARPA), the "monitor group" (TOPS-10 OS development),
      MicroComputer Software (terminal emulators forever !), large
      systems software (billing et. al.), and of course the genius of
      the founders (John Goltz) and the vision of Jeff Wilkins (CEO
      1970-1985).

      There's a lot to be said for being in the right place at the
      right time, and for having a team, but many things do not happen
      without the essential contributions of amazing individuals.

      Thanks Steve.

***** Footnotes

[fn:2] Steve corrected me.  There were never actually plans to write
an Ada compiler.  But I was unaware of the XBASIC compiler.   So 3
compilers in all.

[fn:3] Steve informs me he was NOT pulled into the WOW project.  Maybe
the outcome would have been better if he had...


[fn:1] yes, there are many better tools for this job, but not in the constrained environment where this had to run.

     So, when life turns uncertain you have two choices.   Cling to
     things that seem to add stability and certainty, i.e. try to "stay
     safe", or embrace the uncertainty, live now, carpe diem, and do
     things would seem to be fulfilling now.

     I'm choosing the latter.  At 58, in the middle of a pandemic and
     social unrest, I'm moving to a startup. The following are notes
     from a friend who has been playing the silicon valley startup game
     for a few decades.   These are notes-to-self and anybody else who
     cares from that conversation:

     - Map out the architecture of the org/org structure (official)
       vs. what is actually working
     - Whats the (people) API: theory, practice?
     - Find "they guy who built it, knows everything"
     - What is the aspirational architecture vs. what's really built?
     - Find "the guy" who has it all in his head, maybe stuff that has
       not made it to paper.   Whiteboard it, write it up.
     - Most places don't do that
     - Look at reality vs. getting stuck in "my teams perspective"
     - Use systems thinking to figure it all out
     - Find the "old salts" who know where the bodies are buried, not
       "official channels"
     - "First 90 Days", book
     - "An elegant puzzle", book
     - #1 lesson for all startups: "IT'S ALL ABOUT HOW MUCH CASH YOU
       HAVE IN THE BANK"
     - If company is healthy, CFO knows burn rate, want's whole company
       to be thinking about it
     - Health check: how aware are people of cash position?
     - Build vs. buy
     - Bailing wire and duct tape?
     - WATCH BURN RATE, WATCH REVENUE
     - Valuable people: people who understand tech and that you have to
       be a functioning business,  i.e. you need more $ revenue than
       you are spending
     - People should be excited about growth
     - Watch out for scaling company before projected/actual growth in revenue
     - Biz/finance folks should be excited about you being interested
       in finances.  Defensiveness is a warning sign.   You WANT people
       who care about $.  People share what they are interested in
     - Working remote, COVID
       + open door policy?
       + Ask admin assistant "Can I get 1/2 hour on X's calendar"?
       + Have/ask leading questions
       + Dig into current, next challenges

     - reward/appreciated if you are seen as someone who wants to make
       things work, shape product
     - not "staying in my lane"

     - You should have a mentor
     - there should be a doc that includes "what IT didn't tell you
     - "When I build systems, I try to build something with good
       [benefits?] but light filling" (e.g. don't over-engineer)
     - Two bad extremes:
       + Try to build something that works now, don't "boil the ocean"
       + Pure agile people...constant refinement, incrementalism.
     - e.g. you know you need a memory managers.  Start with an
       interface.
     - People.  There are always "a few of 'those' people", hard to
       work with, disrupt everything.   Stay away.

     And on a happy note...my son Bryan has finished his Masters of
     Piano Performance at Duquesne University and will be headed to
     Penn State to pursue a Doctor of Musical Arts.  You can watch

***** Bryan's Music

     The corona virus has wreaked havoc with many things, not the least
     of which is the performing arts, but, as they say, "the show must
     go on".  The program was to have been a live performance, but
     things being what they are (social distancing) recordings where
     made to satisfy the requirement.

     The program includes:

     - Schumann: Symphonic Etudes, Op. 13 (original version, 1837)
     - Debussy: Images Book II - I. Cloches à travers les feuilles
     - Debussy: Images Book II - II. Et la lune descend sur le temple qui fut
     - Debussy: Images Book II - III. Poissons d'or
     - Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - I. Allegro marcato
     - Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - II. Presto misterioso
     - Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - III. Adagio molto appassionato
     - Ginastera: Piano Sonata #1, Op. 22 - IV. Ruvido ed ostinato

    I particularly like the Debussy.

***** Other Happy Notes

 My other son Daniel is finishing out his junior year at Cedarville
 from home.  Bryan's girlfriend (also graduating from Duquesne) will
 again spend the summer doing something she loves, counting birds for
 Bird Conservancy of the Rockies.  A "kid" I knew from scouting is
 headed off for a masters in biomedical engineering this fall, and we
 may hike together a week or two if possible in June or July.

 Life goes on.   All is not doom and gloom.   There are some happy
 notes.  Share some of yours?

 I find that when I stay glued to twitter (pick your
 social-media-of-doom-amplifier) I tend to get a rather gloomy view of
 life.  There is indeed a lot one can be gloomy about these days.  But
 if you just go for a walk and look around you may be
 surprised:

 I found this art [[pic:sidewalk-art][sidewalk art]] at just about the exact place where last
 fall I had purchased a cup of lemonade from 4 eager young
 entrepreneurs.  I suspect the ring leader of that optimistic young
 bunch.

 Spring is the best time of year.  The daffodils bloom, [[pic:dogwoods][dogwoods are in

 I have [[pic:grass][full luscious grass]] (that has to be mowed).  This may not happen
 again:

 the almost metallic, shinny dark blue back and white belly (the

     I was on email as early as 1980 on a DEC20. I was on Usenet news
     when it was the digital frontier and on the Internet in the
     mid-80s, 10 years or so before the Web.  I helped bring America
     online working at CompuServe before America Online existed.  I
     quit Facebook in the run-up to the 2016 election as it got too
     political and now I find that my main digital platform (Twitter)
     is home to the daily, um, ?sophisms? of the President who spawned
     the political rhetoric I fled.

     Is it time to move on?  Time to find another avant-guard tech hole
     to clime into?  Thanks to the Internet there are infinitely more
     options than just the dial-up BBS systems of the early 80s.

     I was a little sad to loose contact with all the elementary school
     friends that Facebook enabled me to reconnect with after 40 years
     (OK, not really) and I would be sad too loose touch with the zany

 Getting started in life is harder right now.  I have two college age
 sons who both just finished up their year with online classes, and
 both are home now. In "normal" times they would be working summer jobs or participating
 in other activities that would help them advance toward their chosen
 careers.  Jobs may or may not happen.  Even getting out of the house
 may not happen much.  These are weird times.

 I am happy to help my sons with a place to live, emotional and other
 support, but it is a time of life where they should be moving towards
 increased independence.  The opportunities to do that are drastically
 reduced right now.  This state of affairs concerns me, and it's not
 just my family.  Maybe we need to look for the silver lining, find
 opportunity in change, etc., but it is certainly going to take more
 effort and intentionality right now.

****** Harmonia Sacra - a capella four part shape note singing
        I sing (the quality is arguable at times). For the past 25
        years on-and-off I've been singing 4 part a capella hymns in
        Mennonite circles.  It's a communal thing.  You /can/ sing the
        bass line by yourself, but it's not the same.

        For the past 10 years or so, my family and I have been driving
        over to Shenandoah Valley 2 or 3 times a year to participate in
        a few of the annual "sings" that have been happening in the
        area since Joseph Funk first published [[https://harmoniasacra.org/][Harmonia Sacra]] in 1832
        (in the little town of "Singers Glen"[fn:4])

        Since we could not have the regular April singing in person, I
        figured out how to host one on Zoom, based on [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50NoWIiYECA][instructions for
        leading Chorial Music over Zoom by Jim Daus Hjernøe of the
        Royal Academy of Music in Denmark]]

        #+caption: RAMA Vocal Center, Denmark
        #+label: pic:rama
        file:images/royal-academy.png


        Basically, I split out a number of tracks from one of the
        better sings and rebroadcast the them as guide tracks.  [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ALCFebmtOjjm74y540sKTAc6wH-rsKTQ/view?usp=sharing][Here is
        a recording of "Dedication Anthem", a.k.a., "606"]], a.k.a.  "The
        Mennonite National Anthem" sung in 4 part harmony by 400 people.

        It worked, more or less.  There was not the same sense of
        community as standing right next to other singers, but it let
        out some our pent up need to sing our favorite joyful songs in
        a time of uncertainty.

****** "Movers and Shapers"

        There is another, larger tradition of shape note singers called
        [[https://fasola.org/][Sacred Harp]].  When looking or examples of how to put together
        online singings, I came across [[https://sacredharpaustralia.com/resources/singing-shape-note/][Sacred Harp Australia]], who put
        up a video of a Fa-So-La "singing school".  Unlike Harmonia
        Sacra sings, the Sacred Harp singers sit in a square/circle "by
        parts" (Bass, Tenor, Alto, Soprano).

        The Sacred Harp singers took remote singing to an entirely
        different level with [[https://youtu.be/LDbOD3OO20g][The Sacred Harp Quarantine Chorus -EASTER
        ANTHEM - 360° Virtual Singing and Easter Egg Hunt!]].  This an
        amazing recording of 331 singers from 37 states, 4 Canadian
        provences and 11 countries singing a joyful song "together".
        This 360 degree video puts you you in the best seat in the
        house. And here's how they did it:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RIEJOK_m1ek

****** The pros in Nashville

        And then there were the pros in Nashville.  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDIJz6zzHNU][The Nashville
        Studio Singer Community - Virtual Cell Phone Choir - “It Is
        Well With My Soul” arranged by: David Wise]] This was a group of
        professional singers, who indeed looked like they were enjoying
        being part of the virtual community of singers.  They covered
        the standard hymn "It Is Well With My Soul" which was written
        by Horatio Spafford in response to the loss of his family when
        a ship sank.

        When sorrows like sea billows roll;
        Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say
        It is well, it is well, with my soul.
        #+end_quote


        Whatever your faith, I think we can all take a little solace in
        the human spirit that can't be contained and overflows into
        joyous music even at times like these.  It is indeed well with
        my soul.

 Life goes on, until it doesn't.  Then those of us who are still here
 are often left with the cherished collections of a generation, or two,
 or three, or four, or...  The oldest thing I think I have in the house
 is this page torn out of a family bible (I have at least 3 of them,
 big, old, once-cherished).  It records the death of a William Gould in
 1792, and of Joseph Dennis Gould in 1835.

 I also have lecture notes Joseph Gould took at seminary, as describe
 in this slightly edited email I sent to a relative a few years ago.
 There were some big things going on in those days.


 #+begin_quote
 And here, almost certainly is the Dr. Beecher in question.  Father of
 Harriet Beecher Stowe [Uncle Tom's Cabin].  Calvinist evangelist at
 the head of the second great awakening, leader in the temperance
 movement and at the center of a controversy at a seminary in
 Cincinnati about slavery the same year [1834] these notes were
 taken...18 straight nights of debate on the topic, near riots, 50
 students withdrawing en mass and moving to Oberlin college.  The
 church and the nation [were] starting to pull apart.

 And then there was this barn [built by my ?great-great? grandfather
 Morrison for my other great-great grandfather ?Ephriam Gouuld?] north
 of Marietta [Lower Salem, Ohio] that housed runaway slaves. It was a
 stop on the underground railroad just north of the Ohio river. And 27
 years later another young man [my great grandfather Elisha Morrison,
 later to marry Lydia Catherine Gould] who enlisted in the union
 army....


 http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_Beecher

 .... I have a book that appears to have started as Joseph Gould's
 notes on "Dr. Beechers lectures on theology" in 1834, then used by
 Daniel Gould as his account book from 1847 to his death in 1851.  Then
 it contains Ephraim Gould's records as administrator of the estate,
 later records of Morris Morrison and and E F Morrison through 1891,
 and finally entries from Anna Gould from 1923 to 1925.  We have Anna
 Goulds will dated 1925.  I think I was told she was a sister to [my
 great grandmother] Catherine Gould Morrison and cared for Ephraim
 Gould in his old age, which is probably also why I have his
 cane..... I guess paper was scarce....

***** What is this and who is it for?

      This is written primarily as a personal reflection to my cousin
      about us both winding up with tons of family "stuff".
      Secondarily it is intended for a family newsletter.  Tertiarily,
      for my sons to document snippets of family history, and lastly
      (quarternarily ?) it is written as an "open letter".

***** To John
  John, you and I both have a lot of "family stuff", for different
  reasons I think.  I sort of inherited it as, literally, "the last man
  standing".  I care about it some.  I've been told stories about some
  of it my whole life.  I think you have been a little more active
  (well, a lot more active) in collecting and organizing "family
  stuff".



***** Some (more) of the stuff I have
      I have (top of the head, small sample) the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crokinole][Crokinole]] game board
      (19th century I think), the big old custom-made oak cabinet (that
      has moved exactly 3 times since it was made in the 1860s), two
      old oak kitchen tables (Grandma/"Esther Morrison"'s and Ernie's),
      our great grandmother's 1868 wind-up clock with which she "set up
      housekeeping", wall hangings, family bibles, hymnals, cookbooks,
      school books, farm records, the founding constitution of the
      Union Soldiers Aid Society (1863) of the Dry Run Church, tools
      (Grandpa's scythe), and until recently we had the Civil War Diary
      of Elisha Morrison and his discharge papers.  Mike has the rifle
      Elisha Morrison picked up after the other one he had was struck
      by a bullet saving his life, or none of us would be here today.

      On the Jones side I have all Dad the photography major's
      negatives, the Jones/Reeder/Williams family records, my
      grandmother's family photo album showing Dad's high school dance
      band practicing (led by one of Nancy's former neighbors
      ... small world) and pictures of the TV showing live atomic bomb
      test blasts and the coronation of Queen Elizabeth  (who is STILL
      on the throne, is she immortal?)

      If anybody in the family wants some "family stuff" talk to me.
      Much of it can be had cheep (free).  I may be making an inventory
      which would aid your selection.

***** What's the value?
      Some of the people we have behind us include Pilgrims (John
      Alden, Priscilla Mullins), "Underground Railroad" participants
      (Ephraim Gould), Union Soldiers (Elisha Morrison) and on "Esther
      (Free) Morrison"'s side a Hessian Soldier from the Revolution
      who jumped ship and took the name "Free" with some connection to
      the zany "[[http://yesteryear.clunette.com/immortaljn.html][Immortal J. N. Free]]", and then there's "Cousin Henry
      [Longfellow]" (also descended from John Alden)

      #+begin_quote
      Tell me not in mournful numbers, life is but an empty
      dream....life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not it's
      goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest, was not spoken of the soul
      #+end_quote

      It's good to know where you came from.   It's good to know the
      laudable deeds of your ancestors.   Not everybody has that.  Not
      all deeds we know about were laudable or momentous,

      #+begin_quote
      "Though it's the laughter, we will remember, whenever we
      remember, they way we were ... the rest we simply choose to
      forget" (B. Streisand)
      #+end_quote

***** Where is the stuff going?

      I often wonder where this stuff is going.   Some of it's been
      around since the 1700s.   Apparently somebody has cared about it
      in every generation since then.   Maybe I'm the last.   Maybe it
      will finally wind up in the dump (Bryan, Daniel, Doug, Meg
      .... your call :-))

***** Where are WE going?

      At one level *we* are stuff.   I think you and I may both have a
      date to join all the loved ones we know in the Frankfort cemetery
      in the next few years (every time I go there I look around and
      say "Thelma/Bess/Mom/Dad/Grandma...what are YOU doing here?".  As
      time goes on I "know" more and more people there.

      Until then, back to "Cousin Henry"

         #+begin_quote
         Let us, then, be up and doing,
         With a heart for any fate ;
         Still achieving, still pursuing,

         #+end_quote

      And one of the passages that I'm sure inspired him:

      #+begin_quote
      54 But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable,
      and this mortal will have put on immortality, then will come
      about the saying that is written, “DEATH IS SWALLOWED UP in
      victory. 55 “O DEATH, WHERE IS YOUR VICTORY? O DEATH, WHERE IS
      YOUR STING?”  [[https://biblehub.com/nasb/1_corinthians/15.htm][1 Corinthians 15]]

***** Closing

      Stay safe during this strange (COVID19) time.  Enjoy time with
      your family.  Enjoy your genealogy work (and thank you).  Thanks

***** Personal History

      I started following the Cincinnati Reds in'74 and went to my
      first game in 1975.  In part, this was as a way to retain some
      connection with my Grandfather who died early in '74.  My first
      baseball memory is of watching the final out of the '72 world
      series against Oakland with him.

      The mid-70s were a good time to start following the Reds.  "The
      Big Red Machine" (Rose, Bench, Perez, etc) had been in the series
      in '70 and '72 and wound up as World Champions in '75 (RedSox, 7
      games, lots of drama) and '76 (swept the Yankees in 4 games).  I
      was in the stands for one game in each of those series.  Joe
      Morgan won back-to-back MVP awards, Foster had an amazing 52 home
      run year in '77.  There was more than hope there.  There was
      accomplishment to admire by one of the best teams in the history
      of the game.

      Then there was Pete (Rose).  Mr. Cincinnati, "Charlie Hustle",
      "The Hit King", batting champion, MVP, a 44 game hitting streak
      in '78.  He eventually passed Ty Cobb's all-time hit count
      dumping a single in to right on September 11, 1985 (and THAT for
      me will, will always be THE event of 9/11).  I was there and had
      driven 3 straight nights from Columbus to be in the stands for
      the event.

      file:images/pete_and_ken.jpg


      I was in the stands again for another series victory in 1990 over
      the A's, which helped mitigate some of the pain caused by, shall
      we say, Pete yielding to his competitive spirit a little too much
      the previous year and as a result being banned for life from the
      game.

      There have been good times (see above) and bad times including
      the early 80s after Dick Wagner prematurely dismantled the Big
      Red Machine, and the last 5 years where the Reds have finished
      last.  But opening day was always a day of hope.  A clean slate.
      A new start.

*****  Traditions

      Baseball is (was?) a game of traditions.  Cincinnati had always
      been accorded the privilege of having the first opening game of
      the season in honor of their being the first professional
      baseball team (undefeated in 1869) and having, to some degree,
      inspired the birth of professional baseball itself.   That
      tradition ended sometime in the 80s or 90s in favor of increased
      revenue to MLB from TV contracts having other teams open.

      I had my own traditions.  I attended 27 straight opening day
      games from 1976-2002.   That streak ended the year I moved to
      Virginia, not because it was too far, but because the event had
      become a zoo and it became more of a crowd/media event than a
      time for fun and relaxation.   Since then, I've attended at least
      one game every year running that streak to 46 years.   That
      tradition too is in jeopardy if there turns out to be no 2020
      season due to COVID-19.

      And then there are the obligatory pre-game stops at Skyline Chili
      for coneys and chili-spaghetti before the game and Greater's ice
      cream after the game.  If you're from Cincinnati, you know.

      The sound of the Reds broadcasters, "Marty and Joe" (and later
      others after Joe retired), has been the backdrop to so many of
      our lives.  Listening on the radio, in the car, out in the yard,
      late at night.  Joe signing off with is signature "Rounding third
      and heading for home", and Marty's call "And this one belongs to
      the Reds" after every victory.  Marty retired last year.

      And then there were the friends and family that went with me.
      Dad took us to my first game against his hometown Pittsburgh
      Pirates.  Mom was in the stands with me the night Pete got 4192.
      I think my brother Mark was there the night Seaver pitched a
      no-hitter.  My (future) wife Stephanie learned quickly that this
      was part of life.  Son Daniel still has a life-long streak of one
      game a year going.  And my friend Ken (two whom this missive is
      dedicated) has been to games with me for something like 40 years,
      including 20 or so opening games.  And for the record, the Davy
      Concepcion was a better shortstop than Larry Bowa :-)

***** What now?

      I was mentally gearing up to give Tommy Thrall a chance.  He was
      to slated to replace Marty this year.  The Reds spent significant
      money in the off-season building a team to get out of the cellar
      and back into contention.  I was willing to hope again.

      I was already toying with ending my 46 year streak this year
      anyhow.  A few years ago baseball started using TSA-style metal
      detectors at the ballpark.  Just as Opening Day became a zoo,
      there is something "too corporate" about MLB games these days, in
      contrast with, say, local minor league games.  "Money-ball" has
      turned the game into a series computer/stats driven calculations
      where it is impossible to second-guess the manager without your
      own data analysis infrastructure and machine learning models.  I
      no longer understand the basic stats, and I do data analysis for
      a living.  My friend Ken refuses to carry a smart phone and it
      becoming nearly impossible to get/use paper tickets anymore.  Add
      to that the possibility of having to wear masks and practice
      social distancing in stadiums designed for anything but that
      and it feels to me like the "national pass-time" will have
      transformed into some kind of Orwellian panopticon.  No thank
      you.  I wish major league baseball the best.  It's been a
      wonderful part of my life.

***** Moving forward together

      Life moves on.  We can get stuck in the past or remember it
      fondly (or not), learn from it, and move forward.

      The "national pass-time" may never be back, unless you count
      socially-distanced people staring at their cell phones not
      talking to each other as a "pass-time".  People don't walk or
      drive their horse-and-buggy to the "ball-field" anymore.  People
      don't sit on their front porch waving at passers-by.  You can't
      just play hooky from school or take the day off work for a
      relaxing afternoon in the sun forgetting your problems watching
      the "Mudville Nine" and cheering on the Mighty Casey.

      So we (I at least) will enjoy the memory of what was, and look
      for new ways to slow down, new ways to enjoy life, and new ways
      to spend time with family and friends.   To all those who've
      enjoyed a game or two or thirty with me, thanks.  I enjoyed your
      company.

      Look me up if there's some kids headed out to the pasture on the
      "back 40" for a pick-up game, a local little league game or a
      church softball tournament.    Let's spend time together.   Let's
      enjoy life together.

     I recently picked up reader of samples of important ancient texts
     that I've had for a LONG time and read excerpts from Socrates
     Apology.  Short version:

     - Oracle of Delphi :: "Socrates is the wisest man"
     - Socrates :: Nice hypothesis, Apollo, you may be a god, but let's test it....
     - Socrates :: Seeks out "The Wise" of his day, Politicians, Poets,
       Artisans ... questions them ... has them all expose themselves
       as blithering idiots.
     - Socrates :: OK, "The Wise" are all blithering idiots.  They are
       not wise.   The hypothesis holds ... for now.
     - The Wise :: (still mad), Yo, Socrates, here's some hemlock
       (poison).  Drink up...

     There is nothing new under the sun.  In the mid 20th century, in
     response to questions about "what is a science" Karl Popper
     proposed "falsification" as a way do delineate scientific theories
     from non-scientific theories.  The basic idea is that one
     counter-example disproves a theory.

     Socrates defense (5th century BC) is a clear example of the method
     Popper had in mind.  There is nothing new under the sun.   And if
     we follow Popper and Socrates, "the science" (or the pronouncement
     of the god) is never "settled".   Conclusions are always
     tentative and are always just one counter example away from being
     rejected.

 You learn things when you read original sources for yourself.

 I recently picked up a copy of [[http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.8.vii.html][Plato's allegory of "The Cave"]].  I had
 known some of the highlights of the story before, the shadows on the
 wall, prisoners thinking that the shadows were reality, since that's
 all they ever knew, of one prisoner being taken out to see the sun and
 seeing the true light, coming back down and trying to, literally,
 enlighten his fellows, and being thought crazy.

 But I had not known the context until reading the original.  He was
 talking about the need for rulers of the state to have a higher
 vision, to have a view of truth, of the transcendent, to willingly
 leave the ivory tower, the "Isle of the blessed" if you will, where
 they desired to spend their whole life in contemplation of the truth,
 and to willingly go back into the cave to enlighten their brethren and
 lead with a knowldge of truth, not desiring the mundane (and false)
 trappings of the world of shadows (power, wealth, leisure, goods) for
 their own sake and for their own use.  Rulers who do not have that
 vision, and who only focus on this life are bad rulers, and everyone
 (including the rulers) loose out.


 #+begin_quote
 Whereas the truth is that the State in which the rulers are most
 reluctant to govern [because they would rather be engaged in
 philosophical pursuits] is always the best and most quietly governed,
 and the State in which they are most eager, the worst.
 ...

 Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive
 for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler,
 and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State
 which offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver
 and gold, but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of
 life. Whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor
 and hungering after their own private advantage, thinking that hence
 they are to snatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they
 will be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which
 thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole
 State.  --- Plato, Republic, 8.vii

     #+hugo: more

     I like to hike.  The Appalachian Trail is near my house.
     Literally the day before the [[http://www.appalachiantrail.org/][Appalachian Trail Conservancy]] (ATC)
     recommended EVERYONE stay off the trail (180 degrees against its
     primary mission), I accepted the responsibility of maintaining a 3
     mile section for the [[https://www.patc.net/][Potomac Appalachian Trail Club]] (PATC).  Just
     yesterday I got word that trail maintainers have a local exception
     and are allowed to be on the trail.  I'm going out this afternoon
     to see how much underbrush needs cut, if there are any trees that
     need chainsaw work, if any work is needed on erosion control, etc.
     It will be a joy to "be out" again.

     A couple weeks before the cronavirus lockdown started, I went for
     a hike on the [[https://www.hikethetuscarora.org/][Tuscarora Trail]].  It was going to be a quick day
     hike.  Up 900 feet, along a ridge, back down.  Maybe 8 miles.
     Going up the hill I fell on a rock and sliced my forearm open and
     wound up going the ER in Romney, WV with 21 stitches.  I accept some
     risk when I choose to hike (there are bears too).  With the
     potential strain on the medical system and emergency care being
     uncertain, I'm choosing not taking risks now.

     I am a "section hiker".  I go out when I can, usually 2 weeks or
     so a year.  I have over half the Appalachian Trail done (1000+
     miles) and had plans to go out Memorial Day (May 25) for two
     weeks.  That's probably not happening.  I'm not young.  I only
     have so many years to get this done.  Health is never a given.

     The ATC asked all hikers this year to call it off: through hikers,
     section hikers as well as day hikers.  Through hikers are people
     who have re-arranged their life, their finances, their work and
     family life to spend 6 months on the trail.  For many, it may be a
     once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  But for most, through-hiking
     involves staying together in shelters on rainy nights, sleeping in
     bunk-houses in hostels, getting rides with local shuttle drivers,
     going into trail towns to shop for re-supply, etc.  These all make
     social-distancing hard.  And there is the assumption that there
     will be /some/ local medical care available, like that which I
     needed when I fell.  So the ATC /asked/ people to shut it down
     this year.

     The last time I was out hiking, the day after my initial
     trail-maintainer training, the parking lot at the trail-head was
     *packed*.  Not sure what I'll find today.  Crowds?  Empty Trails?
     A persistent through-hiker?  People make their own choices.

***** Intro
 This weekend my son Bryan, friends (former scouts from Philmont days)
 Sam and Preston and friend Jack went on an canoe trip down the
 Shenandoah river.  We were only dumped in the river by two of the two
 rapids we encountered.  More on that below.

***** Other people having fun

 Along the way we saw many people out enjoying the Memorial Day weekend
 along the river.  The photo below shows a water slide set up to let
 kids slide into the river, with a twist: the last 10 (3m) feet or so of the
 slide were down a mud bank.  For safety there was a kayak in the water
 to help the fun-havers out if needed

***** Getting Dumped the first time

 The river was up.   Running about 6 feet (1.8m) at Luray.   The outfitters
 along the river recommend only going at 5 feet (1.5m) or less.   Our second
 day out we were making 5 miles per hour (8 km/h).

 We hit the [[https://youtu.be/Zswr_IB9C_A][Compton Rapids]].  The swells were 3 feet (0.9m) or so.  We made it
 about half way through, taking on water, and then got dumped.  Life
 jackets are a good thing.  It was a little dicey floating though the
 end of the rapids.  We kept our paddles and stayed with the
 upside-down canoe.  The only losses were a couple water bottles, cup
 holders and a fishing rod (other canoe).  Most everything was tied
 down.

 We floated 10 or 20 minutes in still-ish water and wound up swimming
 our swamped canoe to the banks where there was a large group camp-out.
 Some of the people (speaking pretty-much only Spanish) helped get our
 sorry selves and swamped canoe out of the water and drained out.  They
 gave us 6 water bottles which replaced the water we had lost.  Gracias
 !


***** Getting Dumped the second time

 [[./images/swamp-number-2.jpg]]

 The second time we got dumped was a about a mile from the end of the
 trip.  Our planning had failed to disclose the presence of these
 rapids, just had it had failed to disclose the possibility of portage
 around the first set (Preston :-))

 The other canoe went first.   We hung back in the smooth (but fast)
 water so as not to run into them if they had trouble.   They did.
 They dumped about half way through.   These canoes were a little heavy
 with gear and people and not horribly stable.  Extra water in the boat
 does not help.

 I decided to go to the shore and work thorough options.   We reached
 shore 10 or 20 yards (9 or 18) upstream from the rapids.   I grabbed a tree
 root to hold us in place, but the current flipped us.   At that point
 I made the call to "abandon ship".   We let the canoe go and swam to
 the bank rather than float the rapids in life jackets.

 We climbed up the bank, staggered downstream and found that our
 friends were a) OK and b) had snagged our canoe.

***** The end

 In the end, we had minimal losses, no significant injuries, no harm,
 no foul?  Live and learn?  Life jackets, tying down your gear and
 quick thinking are your friend.  And fun was had in the face of
 self-selected risks.

 A few years ago, my mother went through the effects of her cousin
 after she died.  It turns out Thelma Jane wrote poetry.  Nobody knew.
 It wound up in the trash.

 Thelma lived alone.  Her husband had died in his 40s.  They had no
 children. Her mother, my great-aunt Bess, lived to 102 and took her
 first motorcycle ride at 100.  My mom had to go through Thelma's stuff
 and Aunt Bess' stuff, most of which Thelma still had.  I now have some
 of the leftovers.  But nobody wanted the poetry.  So it's gone.

 This brings me to the question this article explores: /why write/?

 #100daystooffload #whywrite #poetry

 #+hugo: more

   - Permanence? :: Thelma's poetry is gone.  Even names carved on
     tombstones crumble with time.  If your writing is very good (see,
     e.g., Virgil and Cicero) and you're lucky (see scribes in Celtic
     monasteries) your scribblings on paper, velum or in cyberspace
     might last the centuries and inspire other writers (see Dante).

   - Therapy? ::  I've been journaling (on paper) for a month or so.   I find
     the process quite creative and even cathartic.  And there is
     something freeing about being able to scribble, erase, underline,
     circle, draw arrows from one idea to the next, and in processing
     information a non-linear fashion.  Unexpected connections can be
     made.  I'm a huge fan of [[https://orgmode.org/][emacs org mode]] (this blog post is being
     written in org mode exported using [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] to export a [[https://gohugo.io/][hugo]] static
     web site hosted on [[https://pages.github.com/][Github pages]], but even using the best of
     digital writing tools, there is something not quite as free about
     it.  There is something mentally relaxing about writing on paper
     (and going for long walks).

   - Learning? :: You learn by doing.  The process of writing (can)
     help you organize thoughts.  You often have to research things.
     Putting ideas out there opens you up to criticism.  You have to
     defend or modify your position.   It can be a starting point for
     conversation.

   - Social Connections? :: See Facebook, Twitter, et al.  For all
     their downsides, there is no denying that writing, even the at the
     banal and everyday level of much of "social media" generates
     connections.   I prefer to think it will allow me to maintain
     meaningful connections to people who are important to me in life,
     but my writing may not, in fact, be that noble.

   - Hubris? :: Pride?  Vanity?  Self-importance?  Self-absorption?
     These are all possibilities.

   - Professional Reasons? :: I sometimes write on professional topics, see
     [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/cybersecurity-and-bears/][Bears Attacks and Cybersecurity]]  and [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/reproducable-security-analytics/][Reproducable Security Analytics]].
     A mix of the same motivations is often in play.

   - To kill time? :: In this busy world we don't often feel that we
     have time to kill.  We don't sit on our front porch watching the
     world go by (and, in fact, it's been a hundred years or so since
     the front porch featured prominently in residential architecture,
     at least in the USA.), and even Baseball, the "national pass-time"
     is looking for ways to speed up the game for a public that has
     lost patience.   Maybe we need to slow down and focus on important
     things, or just enjoyable things.   Writing may be one of those
     things.

   - A habit? :: For some people, writing is a habit.  I think that may
     be one of the goals of the [[https://100daystooffload.com/][#100DaysToOffload concept]].  I'm going
     to give it a try.  Thanks [[https://kevq.uk/][Kev Quirk]]


 I'll never know why Thelma Jane wrote her poetry.  I'm still trying to
 figure out why I write.  Maybe it's one of the reasons discussed
 above.  Maybe it's all of them.

***** Experiences after 9 days of blogging

   About 3 weeks ago I decided to start blogging.  For various still
   ill-defined reasons, some of which I explored in a [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/poetry-in-the-trash/][blog post
   contemplating the fate of writing and writers great and small]].
   But it's still somewhat mushy.

   I spent some time coming up the curve on the [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo framework for
   building static web sites]] and the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][emacs org mode counterpart ox-hugo]]
   which let me put up my [[https://eludom.github.io/][Curious Musings]] blog.

   The a few days after that on [[https://fosstodon.org/web/timelines/home][Fosstodon]] (open source distributed social
   media) I came across the https://100daystooffload.com/ challenge
   which, basically encourages you to "just write".   Good timing.
   Here it is.

   #+hugo: more

   I've put out a couple posts that I've put some work into like
   this one about [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/2020-05-06/][Awesome online singing from Denmark to Australia, and
   social distancing too!]] and [[https://eludom.github.io/blog/steve/][a tribute to Steve Wilhite]] who was my
   first mentor and whom some of you know as the creator of GIF (a
   very minor output of Steve's total work that just happened to
   stick).  Some post have been quick.

***** "Yes, but what if /everyone/ did this"?
   Yesterday, also on Fosstodon, Per Gregory@g had this say:

   #+begin_quote
   "Social media:
   Don't use it to impress people, use it to impact people" ~ unknown

   I love this, and I'm going to remind myself of it when on social media.
   #+end_quote

   Wise words.  Basically, "it's not about me" (unless you take the
   catharsis or hubris angles I explored earlier).  OK, it /should not/
   be all about me.

***** Who is /this/ post for?

   So who is /this/ post for and is it useful?  You be the judge.

   Maybe you're interested in getting started blogging, or wondering
   what software you could use, or where you could find new online
   communities that are not monitized by ads, or you want to pay
   tribute to someone, or you're interested in organizing online choral
   singing, or joining meet-ups of new online communities during social
   distancing.  Then this post might be for you.

     So my attempt at "just blogging something" for 100 straight days as
     part of #100DaysToOffload https://100daystooffload.com/ has
     stalled, but that's OK.

     I have a home painting project going that keeps expanding in scope
     every time I look at it.  I've gone on a couple weekend
     [[https://outdoorfoo.wordpress.com/2020/05/17/tuscarora-trek/][backpacking]]/[[https://eludom.github.io/blog/get-wet/][canoeing]] trips, and (biggest time sync of all), I'm in
     the middle of a job change.  That sucks down time and energy.  Oh
     yeah, and the country/world is in a little turmoil right now
     (COVID-19 and protests) which is, to say the least, distracting,
     disorienting, disturbing, destructive and otherwise detrimental to
     a simple goal of blogging every day.

     That said, I think #100DaysToOffload was (and is) a success for
     me.  I've gotten into a "writing mindset."  My paper journaling
     (started just before COVID-19 hit) continues on a mostly-daily
     basis.  A number of the blog entries I've written have spurred
     conversations with friends.  I've posted copies of a couple of
     them on [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgemjones/detail/recent-activity/posts/][my linked-in feed]] because I thought they were relevant
     there.

     I seem to be a failure at building a large social media following,
     but that too is OK.   I write what (to me) is interesting,
     thought provoking stuff and get 3 or 4 "likes" and 10 or 20 people
     reading it.   I guess I'm not cut out to be an "Influencer" or
     "Thought Leader" (both terms I despise).  TED talks anyone?

     I am and always have been about one-on-one relationships.  The
     whole idea of broadcast media (you know, TV, Radio) bothers me.
     You're just "one-of-the crowd".  But then, hyper-targeted
     advertising feed by corporate spying and machine learning isn't
     much better.

     I've taken to writing every blog post (except maybe this one :-))
     with an individual in mind, kind of like an open letter.  I write
     for one person.  Some of the models are Cicero's letters to his
     friends and the correspondence John Adams and Thomas Jefferson
     carried on late in life.  As personal letters, the writing can be
     focused and specific while still dealing with topics of possible
     general interest.  For instance this,
     https://eludom.github.io/blog/the-stuff-of-time/ was written for
     my cousin the family genealogist reflecting on us both having a
     lot of family "stuff".  And this
     https://eludom.github.io/blog/opening-day-2020/ was written for my
     friend Ken who has been going to Reds games with me for 30 years,
     reflecting on changes in the game and why we go in the first place
     (friendships, diversion, traditions, hope...)

     And I'm also writing for myself.   The process of thinking and
     writing let's me collect my thoughts, capture them for myself and
     anybody else who may care.   It also allows me to start
     conversations with people, referencing my writing if appropriate.

     So I'll keep writing.  Don't look for me to complete 100 posts in
     100 days.   Life has not gone like that.   But there is value to
     me, and I think potentially others, so I'll keep it up.

     Day (well, post) 17 of #100DaysToOffload https://100daystooffload.com/

*** Social Media Series                                             :@socail:

      This the first in a series of articles where I do a brain dump
      pf something like 40 years experience with "social media" of
      various forms: Dial-up BBSs, Fidonet, Usenet, IRC, CompuServe,
      AOL, Slashdot, Sourceforge, blogspot, Facebook, Jabber, Google+,
      Twitter, LinkedIn, Mastadon "...we didn't start the fire
      (flame-war?)..."  OK, maybe we did.

      I hope this is useful, or at least interesting.  It may wind up
      just being a mix of introspection, hubris or narcissism, it may
      be part of working up the nerve to quit Twitter as I quit
      Facebook in 2016, maybe I'll even work up the nerve to go cold
      turkey as [[https://musings.tychi.me/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish][tychi]] is doing.

***** Before my time

      To being with, we need to set the stage.  We're here.  Now.  How
      did we get here?  What went before?  Understanding these might
      help us both to live in the world as we find it and figure out
      how to move forward.

      - '- - - ... - - -' :: Yesterday, <2020-08-16 Sun> was the 100th
        anniversary of the first trans-Atlantic telegram:
        https://cryptologicfoundation.org/what-we-do/educate/bytes/this_day_in_history_calendar.html/event/2020/08/16/1597554000/1858-early-telegraph-communications/77123
        In a very real sense, the telegram was the beginning our
        digital age.

      - Telegraphs, Phones, Blind Kids and Steve Jobs :: Phil Lapsley
        wrote a fascinating book called "[[https://www.amazon.com/Exploding-Phone-Phil-Lapsley/dp/0802122280][Explode The Phone]]".  It is
        fascinating story of technology and hacking culture from
        telegraphs to somewhere after Steve Jobs and Woz were going
        door to door in the Berkeley dorms selling little black boxes.
        Phil gave a keynote at [[https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20][USENIX Security]] one year and I was
        there and talked to him a bit ... part of his passion was to
        record the "Phone Phreak" culture that lead directly to the
        modern "Hacking" (good sense) culture while enough of the
        principals were still around.  I talked to "Captin Crunch",
        one of the main subjects of the book at ToorCon one year.
        What a character.  The entire
        hacker/blackhat/freedom-to-tinker movements (and Apple
        Computer) owe him homage.  Just don't give him a piggy-back
        ride.   Phil was also the author of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_News_Transfer_Protocol][Network News Transport
        Protocl (NNTP)]] for for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet][Usenet]] and we may get to why Usenet,
        pathalias, GNUS and friends may or may not have been a good
        idea in later posts.

      I want to pick up the story where I have personal history and
      Phil's book, conveniently runs right up to about that point.

      I guess one of my goals parallels his: to document bits of how we
      got to the "Social Media" (and "walled gardens") of today, as
      I've live through and been a small player in bits of it.

**** TODO material for future articles                             :noexport:
***** The Past                                                     :noexport:
      - Dialup BBS Systems :: once upon a time it was illegal to
        connect modems (or anything else but AT&T equipment) to the
        phone network.  And that was, basically, the only network.
        Some time after that changed, "Dialup Bullitin Board Systems
        (BBS) arrived.  You could dial up and connect to often the only
        line (the home phone in most cases), leave messages, read
        messages, etc.  Communities formed this way.

      - TOPS-20 Bulletin Boards :: I'm not sure, but my first exposure
        to bulletin boards and email ("social media") was probably on
        the Ohio State DecSystem-20.  I had friends who worked there,
        and we later went to school there and thus had a "legitimate"
        accounts.  The world and software I remember is describe well
        here http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/dec20.html.  Kermit (the
        project that the authors of this article ran) was a very
        important piece of software for 10-15 years, a workhorse of
        moving files across dial-up phone connections.

      - Usenet News :: Social media c.a. 1980.  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet][Usenet]] was (is) a
        system that moves messages (posts) between connected computers.
        In the beginning this was dial-up lines.  Mostly between
        universities and research institutions and, of course,
        AT&T/Bell Labs etc.  For a while the USENET "backbone" (the
        long haul links, the well connected site) were run by an
        unofficial cabal internally AT&T (because they had free access
        to "long lines") and traffic was farmed out to local sites
        (universities) for further distribution.  It was the
        quintessential "old boy" network.  To connect, you had to know
        someone and convince them to "give you a feed".  I was on
        sometime from the mid-80s on.

      - I appear in the geologic records :: I make what may be my first
        appearance in the public record on the on the security-digest
        mailing list here
        https://securitydigest.org/tcp-ip/archive/1988/08#000129 (not
        sure why proxy arp source was a security issue ?), but the
        content is typical of the day ... software floating across the
        net (comp.sources.*, etc.) being grabbed (by me) and thrown up
        on an FTP server 'case that was the cats-meow in those days for
        software distribution.  Check out the variety of email
        addressing mechanisms, one familiar, two unfamiliar today which
        expose topology in the email address.
        =he%idt.unit.no@relay.cs.net= =george@cis.ohio-state.edu=
        =!osu-cis!george= Back then, you often had to know how systems
        connected (pathalias anyone ?)  There was a brief period (Hi,
        Karl !) where I was running the official GNU mailing <-> Usenet
        News gateway.  B-News, C-News, NNTP, NNRP, and honey-danbur,
        Oh-My.

      - Preserving history :: At one point it was rumored that [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Spencer][Henry
        Spencer]] (he of regular expression library fame a.k.a
        =decvax!utzoo!henry@ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU= ) had a copy of "every
        Usenet message ever" on tape and there was an effort to collect
        and archive them...I think Google picked up on that effort
        later.  Later the "way back" machine (archive.org) came online
        to try to do similar things for the web.  The ephemeral nature
        of our digital presence and the importance of preserving it was
        apparent (to some) early on.  But I'm pretty sure most
        CompuServe Forum messages are gone forever (anybody got [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuServe#TapCIS][TapCIS]]
        arcives lying around ?)

     One dark and stormy night I broke my DNS.   I decided to move
     beyond =/etc/resolv.conf= and see what demons (daemons?) were
     lurking under the hood.  "Its complicated."  This is the story of
     understanding, debugging and fixing it.

 # If you've ever wondered "what's up with systemd, DNS, and name
 # resolution on Ubuntu" and "how does it all work", you may want to
 # read this journey of discovery.  Or not.  When you turn over rocks,
 # sometimes ugly things crawl out...

     #+hugo: more

***** /etc/resolv.conf


    If you  look at =/etc/resolv.conf= on a Linux system today (Ubuntu
    19.10) you will find something like:

 #+begin_example
# Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)
#     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN
# 127.0.0.53 is the systemd-resolved stub resolver.
# run "systemd-resolve --status" to see details about the actual nameservers.

nameserver 127.0.0.1
search lan
 #+end_example

     But the file seems to change.  I've seen it without most of the
     verbiage above.  I've seen the file contain both 127.0.0.1 and
     127.0.0.53.  Confusing.  systemd?

***** You /can/ edit =/etc/resolv.conf=
     First let me say that despite the dire warnings below, you *can*
     edit =/etc/resolv.conf=, e.g. to make it look like

     #+begin_example
# Generated by NetworkManager
search lan
nameserver 9.9.9.9
     #+end_example

     And it will work until NetworkManager chooses to overwrite the
     file.  Not sure if =sudo chmod 444 /etc/resolv.conf= be enough to
     keep NetworkManager from overwriting it.

***** You /can/ make =/etc/resolv.conf= immutable

 If you /do/ edit =/etc/resolv.conf= you can make it immutable to
 prevent systemd from updating it:

 #+begin_example
$ sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf
$ sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
rm: cannot remove '/etc/resolv.conf': Operation not permitted
 #+end_example


***** Debugging a broken DNS
      I was living dangerously and simultaneously playing with
      https://pi-hole.net/ and letting Ubuntu try to upgrade my system.
      It went south.  DNS stopped working.  The following were some of
      the debugging steps I took to try to understand/fix the issue:

****** Testing resolution - is name resolution working?

       In this phase of debugging, I try to do name resolution as configured:

      - dig - no namserver specified :: I ran =$ dig www.uu.net= to see if everything was working as
        intended.  Nope.  No response.

      - dig - known-good nameserver :: I ran =$ dig www.uu.net
        @9.9.9.9= to see if I could resolve against a known-good
        nameserver.  This worked.  No issues with connectivity/routing.

      - dig - 127.0.0.53 :: I ran =$ dig www.uu.net @127.0.0.53= to see
        if the local systemd-resolved nameserver specified in
        /etc/resolv.conf was working.  Nope.

      - systemd-resolved - how is it configured?  :: I ran =$
        systemd-resolve --status= to see how systemd thought dns was
        configured.  The wireless interface I was using pointed to a
        nameserver (the proxy server on my wireless router) that should work:

 #+begin_example
$ systemd-resolve --status
...
Link 3 (wlp2s0)
      Current Scopes: DNS
       LLMNR setting: yes
MulticastDNS setting: no
      DNSSEC setting: no
    DNSSEC supported: no
         DNS Servers: 192.168.86.1
          DNS Domain: ~.
                      lan
 #+end_example

      - systemd-resolve - let systemd resolve a name :: dig(1) and host(1) are
        not the only game in town for doing command line DNS look-ups.
        Systemd (of course) will do it for you:
        #+begin_example
       $ systemd-resolve www.uu.net
       www.uu.net: 152.195.32.39
        #+end_example
        In this case, it worked, which tells me that systemd-resolved
        is happy and working.

      - try dig again :: Try another "normal" lookup:
        #+begin_example
       $ dig www.uu.net
        #+end_example

        This failed.  The conclusion seems to be that the whatever the
        resolver library is looking at (127.0.0.53) is not working.

      - edit =/etc/resolv.conf= :: Pointing =/etc/resolv.conf= at
         working nameservers fixed the problem:

 #+begin_example
# Generated by NetworkManager
search lan
#nameserver 127.0.0.53  # BROKEN. systemd-resolved nameserver set by NetworkManager
#nameserver 9.9.9.9     # WORKS. quad9 nameserver
nameserver 192.168.86.1 # WORKS. wireless router nameserver
 #+end_example

******* Conclusion - the systemd-resolved is not answering

****** What name resolution processes are running?

       The next question is: what's (not) running?  What's (not) listening?

       To answer these questions, I poked at the network and the
       running processes:

      - nmap - look for listeners :: nmap did not show a DNS listener at 127.0.0.53
 #+begin_example
gmj@ed home-computing [master] $ sudo nmap -v -sU -PS  127.0.0.53

Starting Nmap 7.60 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-05-10 07:51 EDT

Completed Parallel DNS resolution of 1 host. at 07:51, 0.02s elapsed
Initiating UDP Scan at 07:51

Completed UDP Scan at 07:51, 2.80s elapsed (1000 total ports)

68/udp   open|filtered dhcpc
631/udp  open|filtered ipp
5353/udp open|filtered zeroconf
 #+end_example

 zeroconf :: Is zeroconf listening?  What is 5353?

 It looks like 5353 is multicast DNS.

 #+begin_example
$ egrep -i domain\|dns /etc/services
domain		53/tcp				# Domain Name Server
domain		53/udp
mdns		5353/tcp			# Multicast DNS
mdns		5353/udp
 #+end_example

       - lsof -i :: look at listening ports

         Next, I used lsof(1) to look at listening and connected ports,
         successively grepping out the "known" and "uninteresting":

 #+begin_example
gmj@ed home-computing [master] $  sudo lsof -i -n  | egrep -vi established\|dropbox\|ssh\|http\|smtp\|bootp\|ipp
COMMAND     PID            USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
avahi-dae  1064           avahi   12u  IPv4  25434      0t0  UDP *:mdns
avahi-dae  1064           avahi   13u  IPv6  25435      0t0  UDP *:mdns
avahi-dae  1064           avahi   14u  IPv4  25436      0t0  UDP *:42027
avahi-dae  1064           avahi   15u  IPv6  25437      0t0  UDP *:44240
dnsmasq    2538 libvirt-dnsmasq    5u  IPv4  37248      0t0  UDP 192.168.122.1:domain
dnsmasq    2538 libvirt-dnsmasq    6u  IPv4  37249      0t0  TCP 192.168.122.1:domain (LISTEN)
brave     28951             gmj   43u  IPv4 250584      0t0  UDP 224.0.0.251:mdns
 #+end_example

 Looks like avahe-dae[mon] is listening on multicast-dns (mdns) on
 5353, and there are outbound connections to 192.168.122.1:53, which
 *was* a wired connection to the router, but nothing listening on
 port 53.  This is a problem.

****** Why is systemd-resolved not answering - do I care?

       Do I really want to debug systemd-resolved? No.  I was half
       planing on upgrading to the latest Ubuntu release (20.04)
       anyhow.  This seems like the time to do it, rather than
       debugging this problem further.

****** Lessons learned

       - run servers on dedicated systems :: I had been messing with
         https://pi-hole.net/ on this system (a laptop that mostly does
         not move/go off the net).  There was some confusion/doubt
         about whether this interacted badly with things/caused the
         problems.   It may have.  I un-installed it.   But running a
         dedicated server would be better.

       - Failed Ubuntu "upgrade" :: The actual trigger that made things not
         work was an attempt to let the Ubuntu installer upgrade the
         system.  This failed in strange ways.  After running, my
         system which was Ubuntu 19.10 reported (/etc/issue) to being
         18.04 and the pi-hole logs reported that they could not find
         the wireless interface it had been configured to use (but the
         device was still there, same name, still working...)

***** Next Steps

****** TODO Do a hard upgrade to Ubuntu 20.04
       - Full backup, wipe disk, restore...
       - Use ansible, docker, chief or similar to make configs
         repeatable.

****** TODO Set up a server to run pi-hole and other services
       - Possibly re-purpose an old laptop or pogo-plug device running
         something minimal like Arch Linux
       - Use ansible, docker, chief or similar to make configs
         repeatable.

***** Things to learn more about
      - avhai :: So what is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_%28software%29][avhai]]-dae[mon]?  It looks like a
        zero-configuration (I wish !) networking services that uses
        multi-cast DNS on a local network.  Do I need to be running this?

      - systemd-resolved :: I may want to learn more about this, as it is
        part of the new regime in most Linux distros.  But not now.

***** How things used to work
      In 1987 the staff at the Ohio State University Computer and
      Information Science were periodically logging in to SRI-NIC via
      FTP and downloading "the hosts file", that would be =/etc/hosts=
      on today's Unix systems.

      No DNS?  No problem.  Just look up the hosts IP address in the
      local database (flatfile) and off you go.  DNS was new then and
      still rolling out.  Updates?  No problem.  We'll pull the file
      once a week or so....

      Then along came DNS the resolver library.  Just configure
      =/etc/resolv.conf= on your VAX780 running BSD4.2 and let it go
      ask the new-fangled Root Name Servers who was authoritative for
      =.edu= and where to find the SOA for /red.rutgers.edu/.  Poof.
      Life is good for few years on the academic/military/industrial
      not-so-complex Internet.

      Then the Web happened.  Then Window boxes all started getting
      TCP/IP stacks.  And the marketers, hackers, AOL-me-too crowd and
      the unwashed masses all arrived.   And the stress on the nice
      friendly system coordinate by Jon Postel and friends started to
      show.

      Spoofed records?  No problem.  With a "quick" IETF DNS standard
      to permit (require?) people to digitally sign their zones and
      replies, everything will be fine, right?

***** What's in a name?

      People seems to have caught on that to be able to name something
      is to have power over it, so now *evreybody* wants to mess with
      name resolution for all kinds of reasons, ranging from

      - Load balancing
      - Advertising
      - Tracking user behavior
      - Blocking unwanted content
      - Key distribution
      - Security reconnaissance/mapping

***** Ubuntu - How does it today?
      This is an article/post all of its own.  I broke my DNS.  The
      attempts to fix it reveal an odyssey in the discovery of the
      complexity that has acreeted around DNS in the past 30 years.

***** Android - How does it today?
***** Windows - How does it today?
***** Chromebook - How does it today?
***** What about - VPNs
      - Protonvpn
***** What about - DoH
***** Around the edges - The dark web
***** Around the edges - Alternate roots

***** Back to sticks and stones
      DNS and the routing infrastructure represent two of the biggest
      potential points of failure for the modern Internet.

      Take DNS down and most everything does not work...Amazon,
      Apple, Netflix, online shopping, zoom.

      Of course, it would be possible to go back to the world before
      DNS.   As long as you have a fixed IP address and don't mind
      working with network addresses such as  /192.168.8.230/ or
      /fe90::5e3d:4bd8:7e40:3078/ instead of /amazon.com/

      Looks like you don't have to ftp to sri-nic anymore, you can get
      get it from github.com https://github.com/PDP-10/sri-nic

      Wait, no DNS?

      #+begin_example
     host github.com | head -1
     github.com has address 140.82.113.4
      #+end_example

      Make that

      #+begin_example
     https://140.82.113.4/PDP-10/sri-nic
